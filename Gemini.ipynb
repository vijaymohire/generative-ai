This effect was discovered by Walther Meissner and Robert Ochsenfeld in 1933.\\n\\n**Explanation**\\n\\nWhen a superconductor is cooled below its critical temperature, it undergoes a phase transition into a superconducting state. In this state, the electrons in the superconductor form pairs called Cooper pairs. These Cooper pairs have a non-zero spin angular momentum, which means that they can interact with a magnetic field.\\n\\nThe Meissner effect occurs because the Cooper pairs in a superconductor act as a diamagnet. This means that they repel magnetic fields. As a result, when a magnetic field is applied to a superconductor, the Cooper pairs will move to the surface of the superconductor and create a current that will oppose the applied field. This current will expel the magnetic field from the interior of the superconductor.\\n\\nThe Meissner effect is a very important property of superconductors. It is one of the properties that makes superconductors useful for a variety of applications, such as superconducting magnets and superconducting wires.'"
