The quake was centered about 200 miles north-northeast of Port Moresby and had a depth of 28 miles. No tsunami warning was issued, according to the Tsunami Warning Center. Papua New Guinea is on the so-called Ring of Fire, an arc of fault lines circling the Pacific Basin that is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.</td><td>Papua New Guinea is on the so-called Ring of Fire .\n",

The Australians, who won the first match by 150 runs, failed to reach three figures in an innings for the first time since 1984 as captain Ricky Ponting paid for his decision to bat first in bowler-friendly conditions after winning the toss. Pakistan, led by new captain Salman Butt after Shahid Afridi ended his brief return to the Test arena following that defeat at Lord's, then reached 148-3 before rain cut short the opening day in Leeds. Teenage paceman Mohammad Aamer and fellow opening bowler Mohammad Asif took three wickets each as Australia crashed to the nation's lowest first-innings score since 1956 -- when dismissed for 80, also by Pakistan. \"There was moisture under the wicket so I think it was a shocking decision, especially for Australia,\" Pakistan bowler Umar Gul told reporters. \"I don't know what the captain and coach's decision was going to be but if we won the toss we were ready to bowl first. This morning it was swinging a lot and the ball was seaming.\" Tim Paine's leading knock of 17 was Australia's fourth-lowest in a Test innings in which all 11 players have batted. The No. 7 was last man out in a fighting 47-ball stay, scoring one more run than all-rounder Marcus North. Gul also claimed two wickets while Umar Amin dismissed North and was also involved in the run-out of tailender Ben Hilfenhaus. The Pakistanis went into a 13-match losing run against Australia that goes back to 1995, but struck an early blow when the 18-year-old Aamer trapped opener Simon Katich leg before wicket for 13. Afridi quits Tests after 150-run defeat at Lord's . That opened the floodgates as Asif sent Shane Watson (5) and Ponting (6) back to the pavilion at Headingley in similar fashion, and Gul bowled Michael Clarke (3). From 29-4, Australia slumped further to 73-6 at lunch as Mike Hussey (5) also went lbw to Gul and North was caught behind off the medium pace of Amin. Aamer then took wickets with the first two balls of the middle session, bowling Steven Smith and Mitchell Johnson, but Hilfenhaus avoided becoming the hat-trick victim. Australia's bowlers could not extract the same amount of swing from the overcast conditions, and Butt put on 80 for the first wicket with Imran Farhat before being bowled by Hilfenhaus. Farhat also fell short of a half-century as he was trapped lbw by Watson for 45 with the score at 133, and the all-rounder then dispatched Azar Ali (30) seven runs later. Amin (1) and Umar Akmal (8) were unbeaten when bad light and then rain ended a day on which 13 wickets fell for just 236 runs. The series is being played in England due to security issues in Pakistan.</td><td>Australia collapse to 88 all out on opening day of second Test against Pakistan in Leeds .\n",

Gabrielle Giffords, to submit a handwriting sample -- a request that he, thus far, has refused. A motion was filed Monday, out of the office of U.S. Attorney Dennis Burke in Arizona, asking the court to compel Jared Lee Loughner to write out something so authorities can view his writing style. The government wants the sample to compare with handwritten notes found in Loughner's residence that include mentions of Giffords \"as well as references to guns and bullets,\" according to a court document. It says he has resisted such requests to date, \"arguing that the court lacks authority\" to force him to provide a sample. \"There being no other avenue to obtain the defendant's handwriting exemplar, the government now seeks an order to compel,\" prosecutors wrote in the motion. Last Thursday, a federal grand jury returned a new indictment against Loughner in which he is charged on 49 counts -- including murder and attempted murder -- related to the shooting outside a Tucson supermarket in January. The 22-year-old Tucson man was indicted on three counts of attempted murder, including one alleging that he tried to kill Giffords with a Glock semiautomatic handgun during the event she was hosting for constituents. After being shot through the head, the congresswoman is now undergoing rehabilitation at a medical facility in Houston, Texas. The new indictment -- which supersedes an earlier one, which had fewer charges -- adds murder charges connected to the deaths of John M. Roll, a federal district judge, and Gabriel M. Zimmerman, a staff member for Giffords. Loughner also faces charges in the deaths of Dorothy J. Morris, Phyllis C. Schneck, Dorwan C. Stoddard, and a child, referred to in the indictment as C-T G. Nine-year-old Christina-Taylor Green was among those killed in the shooting. Autopsy reports released Monday showed that Zimmerman, Schneck and Stoddard suffered fatal head wounds, while the three others were shot in the chest. Loughner could face a death sentence if convicted, Burke said last week, although prosecutors have not said yet whether they will seek the death penalty. Loughner, who is being held by authorities in Arizona, is expected to be arraigned on the new charges Wednesday in Tucson, the district attorney's office said.</td><td>Jared Loughner is refusing the government's request for a writing sample .\n",

Why did suspect avoid social media? One of the bullets -- she thinks it was early in the shooting spree -- pierced the wall and entered the theater she was in, slashing through her mouth and becoming lodged in her jaw. It will stay there forever, in the lower left part of her jaw. Doctors tell her that removing it would cause too much nerve damage. \"I like the idea. I think it's cool that I have a bullet in my chin,\" she said with a smile, calling it \"a souvenir.\" She considers herself lucky to be alive, and not injured worse. Lori Schafer helped save her that night, and was in court with her Monday. \"It made it hit home,\" she said. \"It wasn't just a picture on the TV anymore.\" \"I just want him to be where he's never going to be able to hurt someone again.\" Opinion: Mass murder and powerful guns . Hicks said that when she was shot, she didn't know what had happened. She started bleeding, but \"thought someone had thrown something at me.

The four-time Paralympic Games gold medalist won a silver medal as part of South Africa's 4x400m relay at the World Championships in Daegu last year, although he was left out of the line-up for the final. He also looked set to be excluded from the individual event in London after failing to run the Olympic 'A' standard qualification mark twice in international competition. But the South African selectors relaxed their qualification rules Wednesday and named him in both events, much to his delight. \"Today is truly one of the proudest days of my life. To have been selected to represent Team South Africa at the London 2012 Olympic Games in the individual 400m and the 4x400m relay is a real honor and I am so pleased that years of hard work, determination and sacrifice have all come together,\" he told his official website. \"I have a phenomenal team behind me who have helped get me here and will now put everything we can into the final few weeks of preparations before the Olympic Games where I am aiming to race well, post good times and maybe even a personal best time on the biggest stage of them all.\" Pistorius, whose legs were amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old due to a bone defect, runs on special carbon fiber blades from which his nickname \"The Blade Runner\" derives.

Rick Perry, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, saying he abused his power by trying to pressure a district attorney to resign. The two felony counts against Perry, a Republican, stem from his threat to veto funding for a statewide public integrity unit run by Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg unless she stepped down, the special prosecutor in the case, Michael McCrum, said. Perry attorney David L. Botsford called the indictment a \"political abuse of the court system.\" He said the action \"violated the separation of powers\" and \"sets a dangerous precedent by allowing a grand jury to punish the exercise of a lawful and constitutional authority afforded to the Texas governor.\" CNN affiliate KVUE reported that Perry will have to report to the Travis County Jail in the capital of Austin to be booked, fingerprinted and have his photo made for a mugshot. Perry can continue to serve as governor while under indictment, KVUE reported. His attorneys could seek to have the charges thrown out, a motion that would delay the case, at the very least. The grand jury in Travis County indicted the governor on charges of coercion of a public servant and abuse of his official capacity. Read the indictment (PDF) The charges have serious political implications, both in Texas and beyond. Perry is entering his final few months in office after a historic 14-year run in Austin. The Republican running to replace Perry is state Attorney General Greg Abbott, who will have to answer questions about the legal drama. Abbott is facing off against Democratic star Wendy Davis, whose campaign is already making hay of Friday's news. Perry's presidential prospects could be damaged. It's an open secret he's laying groundwork for a second presidential campaign after his disastrous 2012 effort. The governor has positioned himself as an early conservative alternative to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, another GOP presidential contender. Perry is scheduled to visit the early primary states of New Hampshire and South Carolina in the coming weeks to meet with Republican activists and legislators. According to McCrum, the indictment alleges that the circumstances around Perry's veto threat amounted to a misuse of state money earmarked by the Legislature to fund the public integrity unit in Travis County run by Lehmberg. The second charge alleges that he improperly used the veto threat to get her to resign following her arrest on a drunk driving charge. She stayed in office. \"I'm ready to go forward (in) my task as district attorney. In this case, the grand jury has spoken and I'm going forward to carry out the duties that have been bestowed upon me,\" McCrum said. \"I feel confident about the charges that have been filed,\" he added. Mary Anne Wiley, general counsel for Perry's office, said the \"veto in question was made in accordance\" with the authority \"afforded to every governor\" under the state's constitution. \"We will continue to aggressively defend the governor's lawful and constitutional action, and believe we will ultimately prevail,\" Wiley said in a statement. Political opponents of Perry, who unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2012, urged him to resign. \"Governor Rick Perry has brought dishonor to his office, his family and the state of Texas,\" the Texas Democratic Party said in a statement. \"We call on Governor Perry to immediately step down from office.

Federal Prosecutor Gerardo Pollicita filed a 61-page report essentially endorsing what prosecutor Alberto Nisman claimed before he died in January: that evidence shows Fernandez and other top officials tried to cover up Iran's alleged involvement in the bombing that killed 85 people at a Jewish center in Buenos Aires. Pollicita sent his report to a judge, who is expected to examine it next week after he returns from vacation. The judge can determine whether the case can proceed to trial. Nisman, a special prosecutor investigating the 1994 bombing of the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association, alleged last month that Iran was behind the attack, and that Fernandez, to help sweeten a trade deal, covered up Tehran's involvement. That trade deal, Nisman alleged, involved cash-strapped Argentina receiving Iranian oil in exchange for meat and grain. Nisman made the allegation in a nearly 300-page report. But on January 18, one day before he was to testify before lawmakers about his allegations, he was found dead in his apartment with a gunshot wound to the head. Nisman filled with fear before his death, friend says . In his trash can, investigators say, was a 6-month-old draft warrant for Fernandez's arrest. Fernandez initially called it a suicide, but a test found no gunpowder residue on Nisman's hands. Fernandez said a few days later that she didn't believe Nisman killed himself, alleging that some members of the country's intelligence agency fed Nisman false information about a cover-up and were responsible for his death. The President and the other accused government officials deny any cover-up in the bombing. Anibal Fernandez, the President's general secretary, said the allegations against Fernandez are \"a clear maneuver to destabilize democracy\" in the South American country. He also said the investigation lacks \"judicial value\" or \"importance.\" About 10 years ago, Nisman was appointed as special prosecutor to investigate the bombing by then-President Nestor Kirchner, Fernandez's late husband.

UEFA said it was acting over \"the setting-off and throwing of fireworks, and the improper conduct of supporters,\" including racist chants and the displaying of racist symbols. The UEFA Control and Disciplinary Body will deal with the case on Tuesday, it said. Croatia drew 1-1 in the match against Italy in Poznan on Thursday, with Mario Mandzukic scoring for the Croatians and Andrea Pirlo claiming a goal for Italy. UEFA president Michel Platini urged fans who are attending decisive matches on Saturday night to \"conduct themselves with dignity and respect.\" Russia plays Greece in Warsaw, while the Czech Republic plays Poland in Wroclaw. \"Of course, there is rivalry and passion, and all teams want to win -- but we must remember that the results on the pitch are what really matter,\" Platini said in a statement. \"EURO 2012 is a celebration of football and I invite the fans, the vast majority of whom have conducted themselves in an exemplary manner so far, to continue to do so for the remainder of the tournament.\" The issue of racism has threatened to mar the soccer tournament, which is being co-hosted by Poland and Ukraine. Members of the Dutch squad claimed to hear monkey noises during an open training session in Krakow, Poland, before the tournament started, though the Dutch FA opted not to lodge an official complaint with UEFA. In addition, family members of two black English players chose not to travel to the competition for fear of being subjected to racism. UEFA has already taken the step of writing a letter to the mayors of each host city asking for a zero-tolerance approach to racist abuse. UEFA's disciplinary body has also been busy since the tournament started just over a week ago. Russia has already been fined and handed a suspended points deduction for improper conduct against the Czech Republic, while also still awaiting the verdict of a UEFA investigation into alleged racist chanting during the match. The German Football Federation was fined $12,500 after its fans threw paper onto the pitch during a meeting with Portugal, with the Iberian team also ordered to pay $6,250 for delaying the start of the second half. A Danish player, Nicklas Bendtner, may also face sanctions next week after lowering his shorts during a game Wednesday to reveal that he was wearing underwear displaying the name of an Irish bookmaker named Paddy Power. Under the laws of the games as outlined by FIFA, the global body which governs soccer, undershorts must be the same color as the shorts worn by the player. His shorts were red but the Paddy Power undershirts were green.

Now, Obama said, it's time to forge deeper economic connections to create more jobs and more trade on both sides of the border. \"That's the focus of my visit,\" he told reporters after meeting with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto in the country's capital. But even as Obama and Peña Nieto pushed to shift the tone more toward trade and economics, security issues loomed large over Thursday's meeting. Peña Nieto said his government remains committed to fighting organized crime, but that the United States and Mexico must \"cooperate on the basis of mutual respect, to be more efficient in our security strategy that we are implementing in Mexico.\" Obama stressed that the countries will continue to cooperate closely on security, but he didn't specify how. \"I agreed to continue our close cooperation on security, even as that nature of that close cooperation will evolve,\" he said. It's up to the Mexican people, Obama said, \"to determine their security structures and how it engages with other nations, including the United States.\" In the meantime, he said, the United States remains committed to reducing the demand for drugs north of the border, and the southward flow of illegal guns and cash that help fuel violence. \"I think it's natural that a new administration here in Mexico is looking carefully at how it's going to approach what is obviously a serious problem,\" Obama said, \"and we are very much looking forward to cooperating in any ways that we can to battle organized crime.\" High-profile cartel takedowns were a hallmark of former President Felipe Calderon's tenure. Peña Nieto has vowed to take a different approach, focusing more on education problems and social inequality that he says fuel drug violence. The details of his policies are still coming into focus, and analysts say his government has deliberately tried to shift drug violence out of the spotlight. Before Obama's arrival, a spate of news reports this week on both sides of the border detailed changes in how Mexico cooperates with the United States. Under the new rules, all U.S. requests for collaboration with Mexican agencies will flow through a single office, Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong told Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency. It is a drastic change from recent years, when U.S. agents enjoyed widespread access to their Mexican counterparts. Critics have expressed concerns that Peña Nieto's government will turn a blind eye to cartels or negotiate with them -- something he repeatedly denied on the campaign trail last year. On Tuesday -- two days before Obama's arrival -- his government arrested the father-in-law of Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, head of Mexico's Sinaloa cartel and one of the country's most-wanted drug lords. Speaking to reporters after his meeting with Obama on Thursday, Peña Nieto emphasized the importance of reducing violence, and also the importance of Mexico's relationship with the United States extending beyond the drug war. \"We don't want to make this relationship targeted on one single issue,\" he said. \"We want to place particular emphasis on the potential in the economic relationship between Mexico and the United States.\" To achieve that goal, Peña Nieto said, the presidents agreed to create a new high-level group to discuss economic and trade relations between the two nations. The group, which will include Cabinet ministers from both countries and U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, will have its first meeting this fall, Peña Nieto said. Imports and exports between the United States and Mexico totaled nearly $500 billion last year, and before Obama's arrival officials on both sides of the border said economic relations would be a focal point during the U.S. president's visit. \"When the economy in Mexico has grown, and people have opportunity, a lot of our problems are solved, or we have the resources to solve them,\" Obama said Thursday. The emphasis on the economy Thursday was a significant shift, said Jason Marczak, director of policy at the Americas Society and Council of the Americas. \"The conversations between Mexico and the United States are changing,\" he told CNN en Español. Obama is scheduled to deliver a speech at the National Anthropology Museum in Mexico City on Friday morning. In the afternoon, he will travel to Costa Rica, where he will meet President Laura Chinchilla and other regional leaders.

Timothy Murray, 29, who is charged with murder, remains at large, authorities in Louisiana say. Searchers are still focusing inside St. Tammany Parish, on the northern shore of Lake Pontchartrain, 30 miles north of New Orleans, said Capt. George Bonnett of the St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Office. At large is Timothy Murray, 29, who is charged with murder, Bonnett said. Authorities believe Murray may have been injured during the escape, but Bonnett wouldn't elaborate. The inmates escaped about 9 p.m. Thursday from the St. Tammany Parish Jail in Covington, Bonnett said. As many as 250 sheriff's deputies, Covington police officers, Louisiana State police and corrections officials were involved in the search overnight, using dogs, two helicopters and thermal-imaging equipment loaned from Livingston Parish, Bonnett said. The other three men were found about 1:30 a.m. Friday in a wooded area about a mile from the jail, he said. Three of the inmates were awaiting trial; one already had been convicted, Bonnett said. The captured inmates were Gary Slaydon, 27; Eric Buras, 30, and Jason Gainey, 27. Slaydon is charged with attempted murder. Buras is a murder suspect and Gainey has been convicted of murder, Bonnett said. He said the escape was not discovered until a resident and Covington police reported seeing what appeared to be inmates in jail uniforms walking down a street. About the time those calls came in, jailers were doing a routine head count and found the four men missing, Bonnett said. He said the means of escape was under investigation, but it has been determined that their escape wasn't due to human error. He repeated what St. Tammany Parish Sheriff Jack Strain said early Friday: \"Four inmates were able to defeat the structure of the maximum security area of our jail.\" Deputies have canvassed neighborhoods, going door to door to warn residents that an inmate is still at large.</td><td>Four inmates escape from jail in St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana .\n",

Especially with rain in the weekend forecast. Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz told reporters Thursday that while the storm may be largely over for snow purposes, authorities are exceptionally worried that buildings will collapse when the heavy snow pack soaks up the rain. \"There's going to be a warm-up on Saturday, there will probably not be a tremendous amount of melt on Saturday,\" he said. \"There will be a rain starting on Saturday that will not initially create a situation where the snow will melt, but it will actually act as a sponge. So the water that is falling will go into the snow pack and will actually act as a sponge until it finally starts releasing it.\" The National Weather Service forecasts light rain to begin Saturday and temperatures to warm. The major concern is flooding, but Poloncarz said the weight on buildings could cause some to collapse. \"There will be even extra weight because of the rain. So this emergency is not over,\" he warned. On Thursday afternoon, Erie County officials said there was a \"significant threat of a roof collapse\" at the 184-bed Garden Gate Health Care Facility in Cheektowaga. Residents reported wall cracks and a sagging ceiling. Several feet of snow piled on the roof. Poloncarz, who had earlier tweeted that the roof was collapsing, later clarified the statement, saying beams in the building were twisted and walls cracked. No injuries were reported and patients were evacuated. Residents were taken temporarily to a business park, said Scott Zylka with the Erie County Sheriff's Office, adding that the roof structure was compromised. The extreme weather has claimed at least 10 lives -- its latest victims two people with mental health issues who died of apparent exposure overnight, Dr. Gale R. Burstein, Erie County health commissioner, said Thursday. And the storm forced the NFL to announce that Sunday's game between Buffalo and the New York Jets, scheduled to be played at the Bills' Ralph Wilson Stadium, will be hosted at Detroit's Ford Field on Monday night. Seeking shelter . At the Winchester Volunteer Fire Company station on Harlem Street, as many as 40 people stranded in the snow have sought shelter since Tuesday. More than 6 feet of snow cover the streets. Abandoned cars are barely visible under the drifts. Fire trucks can't leave the station. Attempts by firefighters to get out in an SUV were futile. One medic hopped on a snowmobile to rush to a call. Other volunteers jumped on ATVs to reach a home where the roof was buckling under the weight of the snow. Maria Odom's two cats and a dog were rescued from the house. \"I'm ready for it to end,\" Odom, 38, said of the extreme weather. \"I've lived here my whole life and I've never seen anything like this.\" At the fire station, driver Steve Randall's truckload of milk and eggs has served as the main source of provisions. Randall said he was stuck in his truck for nearly five hours before making his way to the firehouse, where people have been sleeping on tables to stay off the cold floor. \"We've been eating like kings for a while but now we're running out of food,\" he said. Firehouse occupants have been making quiche, served with milk and bread from a store across the street. From the Tops grocery store nearby, people hauling bags of food headed out into the snow by foot. One man dragged groceries in a sled; another pulled his child through the snow in a laundry basket. Robert Mead embarked on a five-mile trek to bring formula to his 9-month-old baby. A year's snowfall in 3 days? In the past 24 hours, since the latest lake-effect storm started on Wednesday night, more than 3 feet of snow has fallen in several areas near Buffalo. In Wales Center, there was a new snowfall of 37 inches, according to a National Weather Service spotter. Residents just stared out their windows at the mounds of white stuff, if they could see out at all. In East Aurora, Lisa Gutekunst's home was capped with more than 4 feet of snow, she said. \"The snow is coming down so hard you can't see out the window,\" she said earlier Thursday. \"We've cleared our driveway so many times that we've run out of places to put the snow.\" Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown announced a travel ban in south Buffalo for both cars and pedestrians from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m., citing the safety of residents as heavy equipment moved around town. If the forecast holds, more than a year's worth of snow will have fallen in three days. In a typical year, Buffalo's snowfall totals about 7 feet, according to the National Weather Service. Extreme conditions lead to tragedy . Ten people have died, including four who suffered cardiac issues while they shoveled snow and one who died in a car accident, Erie County officials reported. A man in his 60s had a heart attack while he tried to move a snow plow or a snow blower, Erie County deputy executive Richard Tobe said. Burstein told reporters that two residents of Niagara and Erie counties died overnight Thursday of apparent exposure. \"They both had chronic illnesses,\" she said. \"They both had mental health issues, and were found outside either their home or a close friend's home. They had probably been there overnight.\" In Alden, a 46-year-old man was found dead inside a car buried in 12 to 15 feet of snow. In Genesee County, Jack Boyce, a 56-year-old county employee, died after collapsing Tuesday morning while operating a snow blower outside the county sheriff's office, according to County Manager Jay Gsell. Brown and city officials recounted stories of rescuers trudging around snowdrifts as high as houses to get people to hospitals, and police officers delivering special baby formula to a pair of infants. A sporting chance . Wednesday night's football game between the University of Buffalo and Kent State was postponed because the visitors' equipment truck didn't arrive on time. The game has been tentatively rescheduled for Friday, school officials said in a statement. The National Football League announced it would move Sunday's game from Ralph Wilson Stadium, which was buried in an estimated 220,000 tons of snow. The NFL statement said the contest will be played Monday night at 7 ET at Ford Field, which in 2010 played host to a Minnesota Vikings game after the roof of their stadium collapsed due to snow accumulation. Moving the game back a day will help the Bills, who haven't been able to practice this week. The team had been offering tickets to the game and $10 an hour to anyone willing to help remove the snow. Now it is offering refunds to fans who purchased tickets through the team. CNN's Alexandra Field, Leigh Remizowski, Ashley Fantz, Jason Hanna, Ed Payne, Marcus Hooper, Martin Savidge and Catherine E.

(\"Good but not great\" is the consensus so far. ) But it also did well at the SAG nominations, earning three nods, for ensemble, lead female actor Meryl Streep and supporting female actor Julia Roberts. \"Dallas Buyers Club\" also did well, earning nominations for ensemble, lead actor Matthew McConaughey and supporting actor Jared Leto. \"Lee Daniels' The Butler\" and \"American Hustle\" complete the list of nominees for best ensemble, the SAG Awards' closest equivalent to best picture. \"The Butler\" also earned nods for stars Forest Whitaker (best actor) and Oprah Winfrey (female supporting actor). Jennifer Lawrence added to \"Hustle's\" haul with a female supporting actor nomination. And \"Captain Phillips,\" though snubbed in the ensemble category, picked up nominations for star Tom Hanks and a surprise nod for supporting actor Barkhad Abdi. \"Phillips\" is the film debut for Abdi, a Somali immigrant who plays a ship hijacker. But there are a number of Oscar favorites that couldn't get into the ring. \"Her,\" the Spike Jonze work about a man who develops a relationship with a computer operating system, was completely shut out. So was \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" the new Martin Scorsese film, despite excellent early buzz. Keep up to date on who has won what with our Awards tracker . Redford, whose one-man show in \"All Is Lost\" has made him a favorite for best actor, was left off SAG's list. So were Oscar Isaac (from the Coen brothers' latest, \"Inside Llewyn Davis,\" which came up completely empty), Michael B. Jordan (\"Fruitvale Station\") and \"American Hustle's\" Amy Adams and Christian Bale. The most unlikely nominees were focused in the supporting actor category. Besides Abdi, Daniel Bruhl picked up a nomination for Ron Howard's mostly overlooked \"Rush,\" and the late James Gandolfini was honored for his work in the comedy \"Enough Said.\" Though the actors' wing represents the biggest bloc of Oscar voters, the SAG Awards aren't always a great bellwether of best picture success at the Academy Awards. Though \"Argo,\" last year's best picture, also won the SAG Awards' ensemble honor, the 18th annual SAGs went with \"The Help\" over \"The Artist\" and the 16th annual awards tapped \"Inglorious Basterds\" over \"The Hurt Locker.\" The picks for actor and actress, on the other hand, are much closer to the academy's selections. Last year's SAGs went to Daniel Day-Lewis and Lawrence; the year before honored Jean Dujardin (though Viola Davis lost the Oscar to Streep); and 2010 SAGs went to Colin Firth and Natalie Portman. Does it mean anything? Thursday may muddy the waters further, when the Hollywood Foreign Press Association announces the Golden Globe nominations.

But he says they also led to an overreaction that continues today. Zakaria argues the organization behind the attacks, al Qaeda, has been greatly diminished by the U.S. response to 9/11 and by growing opposition to the group in the Muslim world: . \"All these trends have worked to further diminish the threat al Qaeda poses to us. We're in a strange situation where the right doesn't want to acknowledge it because it would suggest we don't need to be in quite this much of a war footing and ... the left seems reluctant to accept some of this because it suggests that, God forbid, George W. Bush might have done something right. \"As a result of our political dysfunction, we have lost the ability to have a rational conversation about 9/11,\" Zakaria said. The author and host of CNN's \"Fareed Zakaria GPS\" spoke to CNN on Wednesday. Here is an edited transcript: . CNN: Is the U.S. safer today than before 9/11? Fareed Zakaria: There's no question we're safer. Look, 9/11 changed the way in which we viewed the problem of terrorism and Islamic radicalism, and we've gotten attentive to both. First of all, there have been huge measures taken -- a series of very simple, sensible measures that decrease the likelihood of anything like 9/11 happening. Sealing the cockpit door, by itself, means that a plane can never be used as a missile and things like that ... the security measures have made it much more difficult for high-value targets to be vulnerable in quite the way they were. The second part is that we have gone after these al Qaeda and associated groups quite vigorously, chasing them around the mountains of Afghanistan of course but also tracking their money. And those things collectively have made a big difference, and there's no question in my mind, we're safer. Now we can begin to ask ourselves whether we have overdone the countermeasures, whether the tens of billions of dollars that have been added year after year to the intelligence budget, to the Homeland Security budget have been all necessary or are we on a kind of autopilot where no request for homeland security can ever be denied, and it has become part of the gargantuan pork barrel projects in Washington. CNN: You've written that we've overreacted to 9/11 and al Qaeda. In what way do you think that's the case? Zakaria: I mean it in two senses. We didn't spend a lot of time in the year after 9/11 -- once we had taken it on, once we had started chasing these people around the world, measures which I strongly supported then and still strongly support -- whether that had been effective and whether we had broken up the organization and made it far more difficult for them to operate. And therefore, what was the real nature of the threat going forward? I think it's clear that al Qaeda is a much-diminished force. It has the power to inspire a series of local organizations around the world, but it has very little power to direct these high-profile terrorist attacks itself. The reaction to my point that al Qaeda is weaker than we think has surprised me only because I've made this point since 2004, and I've made it repeatedly. CNN: Why do you think many people have not agreed with that point? Zakaria: I do think we have a tendency in the United States to underestimate the evil intentions of our enemies, but overestimate their capacity, their capabilities. What we now know, based on all the declassified documents we have available is that in the 1970s and '80s, the U.S. was massively overestimating the military capacity of the Soviet Union. CNN: In what way? Zakaria: If you look at every measure, from bombers to missiles, on almost every count, we massively overestimated their capacity to modernize, their capacity to build up, and as a result we had created a much, much larger military-industrial complex than would have been necessary to combat the actual Soviet threat rather than the one we perceived. Similarly with Saddam Hussein, the intelligence agencies were absolutely convinced that what we faced was a very powerful state that was acquiring nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, which proved to be largely untrue. When we look at al Qaeda, we have to ask ourselves: What is their actual capacity to inflict harm? The second sense in which I mean it is I do think there is a tendency within the American appropriations system for projects to become eternal and eternally expanding and this has clearly become true of homeland security. Nobody wants to deny the request for more security, more measures, more procedures, all of which come with more budgets, more bureaucrats ... CNN: So what should be done now? Zakaria: This would be the right time for us to take a look and ask ourselves, in order to combat the actual threat that al Qaeda poses, which is real but which is limited in some senses -- what kind of intelligence apparatus do we need, what kind of homeland security apparatus do we need and how much can we do in terms in reallocating, reorganizing and reinventing these national security agencies rather than constantly piling up layer upon layer. We now have 15 different intelligence agencies, we have 15 different organizations tracking the money that terrorists are moving around. It's almost as though we took the entire Cold War bureaucracy and rather than scaling it down and reconfiguring it to meet this new set of unconventional threats, we just layered on top of the mountains of Cold War bureaucracy another set of mountains of terrorism bureaucracy, never mind that the Cold War is over ... This is not a way to run a serious national security policy. And the greatest danger here of course is that unlike the Cold War, unlike World War II, this is not a war that has a clean ending, so you cannot set a point at which we would demobilize and therefore get rid of some of this apparatus. This is a kind of existential reality that the United States has to deal with, the possibility of terrorism, the possibility of radical groups being able to inflict harm on an open society, so we've got to ask ourselves is this the normal national security state we want to live with. CNN: Was the concept of a \"war on terror\" mistaken? Zakaria: I don't know if I would quibble with it that much. ... The problem of course is that terrorism is a tactic, you can't declare war against a tactic. But in general it conveyed the idea that we needed to go on the offense and we needed to chase these guys around the world, we needed to track their money. I have no problem with any of that ... the problem is you can fight a war but you also need to actively gauge the strength of your opponent, and if you think he's 25 feet tall vs. five feet tall, that's important. That's a huge misdiagnosis of the problem ... CNN: Why do you think people have missed the change in al Qaeda's capabilities? Zakaria: We're not looking at trends within the Islamic world where al Qaeda has been politically discredited, trends that are taking place within the jihadi community, where prominent jihadis have broken with al Qaeda. The reality is that al Qaeda has been unable to organize a single attack [against a major target in recent years], the reality is that when smaller local groups plan terrorist attacks all they can attack are local targets like cafes or train stations and thus kill locals, further alienating the local population and discrediting and delegitimizing al Qaeda and its associated groups. CNN: Nine years after 9/11, why is the debate about Islam and terrorism fiercer than it's ever been? Zakaria: What's more strange is that it feels as though it's a debate that's taking place without the intervening nine years. Sometimes the debate seems as though it could have been taking place in 2002, without noticing all these trends that I've been describing. 9/11 was a wake-up call for America, but it also was a wake-up call for a lot of people in the Muslim world. In the early months after 9/11, and I wrote about this at the time, there was a sense in the Muslim world that while they might not have approved of the attacks, they understood the anti-Americanism that lay behind it. That kind of totally irresponsible and pernicious implicit support for Islamic radicalism has worn very thin in the last nine years. CNN: Why has radicalism lost support? Zakaria: People who felt that way in Indonesia, in Jordan, even in Palestine have realized that these guys [al Qaeda] are as opposed to the secular regimes of Indonesia, Jordan and in the Palestinian Authority as they are to the United States and when they attack Indonesia and Jordan, they kill innocent Indonesians and Jordanians, innocent Muslims by the way. That reality has also produced a kind of rethinking about Islamic extremism that has been very important. I should emphasize that it is not enough and there needs to be more persistent condemnation of radicalism and violence but there's no question, and the polling data make this clear, the number of fatwas issued against al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden make this clear -- there has been a huge shift in the Muslim world over the last nine years. CNN: Finally, Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf is reaffirming his plans to proceed with Cordoba House, the controversial Islamic center near ground zero. What do you think of that? Zakaria: This is to be a community center that will have a swimming pool, meeting rooms, athletic facilities, modeled after the 92nd Street Y. It will have Jews and Christians and Muslims on its board, it will have prayer rooms for Jews and Christians as well as Muslims. It will have both physical spaces and programs to encourage interfaith dialogue. Now to me that sounds like precisely the American answer to Muslim radicalism, to affirm a Muslim-led process of interfaith dialogue, of tolerance for other religions ... the plan here is to build a center that is really trying to bring people together, this is such an American response to intolerance, extremism and violence. It is about inclusion, dialogue and respect for other faiths.</td><td>9/11 led U.S. to strike back at al Qaeda and take smart measures, says Fareed Zakaria .\n",

Horrific attacks are being reported, including the torching of a church where people who had sought refuge were burned alive. At least 148 people have been killed and about 75,000 have fled their homes since President Mwai Kibaki won a narrow victory, according to Kenyan government officials. The Associated Press reported a higher number -- about 275 -- have died since Saturday. Much of the violence is between supporters of Kibaki from the majority Kikuyu tribe and backers of opposition leader Raila Odinga, who is from the Luo tribe. The ethnic violence, previously rare in Kenya, is reminiscent of the strife that led to the Rwanda genocide.  In a particularly disturbing incident, a mob appears to have burned a church filled with Kenyans seeking refuge from the violence. The Red Cross told The Associated Press that at least 50 were burned to death at the church, some of them children.   As many as 200 people were at the church, about 185 miles northwest of Nairobi, KTN reporter Tony Biwott told CNN. Watch as machete-wielding looters haul away goods » . Biwott said he counted at least 15 charred bodies, including children, in the burned church and an adjacent field. \"I'm sure there were more than 15 but I couldn't count the ones who were ashes,\" he said in a phone interview. The wounded sustained gunshot wounds, burns and cuts from a panga, a machete-like weapon, the Red Cross said. Watch smoke darken skies near a burned church . The national police commissioner has said in Kenyan society, churches are considered sacred and no one would expect such violence there. He said an investigation into the incident is under way. About 120 people are reported dead and over 1,000 injured countrywide, according to The Red Cross. Police and political backers of opposition leader Raila Odinga began clashing about four days ago as Odinga, of the Luo tribe, narrowly lost Kenya's presidential election to Mwai Kibaki. Kibaki is a member of Kikuyu, Kenya's largest tribe. Violence broke out in several cities as frustration mounted during the slow hand-count of the ballots. Kibaki was re-elected with 51.3 percent of the vote, to 48.7 percent for Odinga. \"What we now witness is a cold and calculated plan to organize and engage in massacres,\" government spokesman Alfred Mutua said. Bringing in the New Year, Kibaki -- who rarely speaks to the press -- urged calm to the nation. \"It now is a time for healing and reconciliation amongst all Kenyans,\" he said. Foreign Minister Raphael Tuju said the government is committed to taking control. \"If the tear gas doesn't work then unfortunately they have to use live bullets,\" he told CNN. \"The president has been sworn in, the elections are over, the Kenyans have to accept the results, the opposition has to accept the results.\" Tuesday, international observers said the balloting fell short of international standards for democratic elections. Alexander Lambsdorff, the head of the EU Election Observation Mission in Kenya, cited discrepancies in vote counts, election observers being turned away from polling places and observers being refused entrance to the electoral commission vote-counting room. The violence also has displaced some 75,000 Kenyans inside the country, Mutua said. The government said Tuesday it will not allow any political rallies in the aftermath of the controversial election outcome. Odinga's opposition Orange Democratic Movement had scheduled rallies for Tuesday, raising fears of more violence. Mutua said there was no intention to impose a state of emergency or curfew at this point, and said police are handling the violence well and with \"extreme restraint.\" However, he warned that police restraint would not last forever. The violence is rare for Kenya, which has enjoyed relative calm even as war and chronic political violence wracked neighboring countries, such as Ethiopia, Sudan and Uganda. The United States has withheld congratulations for Kibaki, citing concerns of voting problems, even though Kibaki has claimed victory.

Many of us felt vulnerable, unsure what the next days would bring. Communities are still reeling from the aftermath and the most difficult period may still be ahead. But as our city begins to rebuild and recover, New Yorkers and others in the region who already struggle on a regular basis will have the hardest time getting back on their feet. Thankfully, we've seen a huge outpouring of support and number of people willing to donate their time and resources to help. And for those willing to pitch in, please join us. Our government is certainly doing its best to help those in need in the aftermath of the storm, but the nonprofit sector plays such a critical role in the delivery of health and human services across New York City and throughout the country. Numerous low-income families depend on vital community-based nonprofits to access the services they need for daily living. That is one reason why United Way created the United Way Hurricane Sandy Recovery Fund (#sandyfund). Local United Ways along the Eastern Seaboard will use contributions to the fund to address the near- and long-term recovery needs of communities most affected by the hurricane. In addition, the fund will bolster United Way community impact partners that serve hurricane-affected individuals and families who are already vulnerable -- struggling with food insecurity and the ability meet their most basic needs. Disasters like this unprecedented storm undoubtedly impact all of our communities. Our most under-resourced communities, however, have been trying to make ends meet even before Sandy barreled in. For the third straight year, New York City's poverty rate has been on the rise according to census bureau data, with one in five New Yorkers lacking enough income and earnings to pay for basic necessities. In fact, United Way of New York City's most recent hunger survey found that two-thirds of New Yorkers were concerned that someone they know will need help getting and paying for food in the next 12 months. Map: See images of destruction, recovery across the East Coast . These financial pressures are exacerbated when an unexpected hardship like a natural disaster strikes. Some families' primary earners continue to lose hourly wages because they can't get to work. In other cases, those jobs no longer exist as flooded offices and businesses have been forced to close. The loss of even a week's income can be devastating, never mind being suddenly thrust into unemployment. Plus, tens of thousands of New Yorkers will be displaced for weeks to come. Some may be unable to return to their homes at all. It is not the first time United Way has stepped in to help those most in need. For example, following the 9/11 attacks, United Way of New York City created the September 11th Fund in partnership with The New York Community Trust, raising and distributing more than $500 million. Following the devastating earthquake in Haiti in 2010, United Way of NYC partnered with the Brooklyn Community Foundation to found and fund the NYC Haitian Hope & Healing Fund to address the short- and long-term needs of affected individuals residing in New York. And following last year's Hurricane Irene, United Way of New York State set up the Hurricane Irene Recovery Fund to help those in need. Our needs today remain just as great. Early estimates put Sandy's damage at $30 billion to $50 billion in losses. Let's not forget about our already struggling low-income families who will feel these losses deeply.</td><td>United Way's Hurricane Sandy Recovery Fund helps low-income families .\n",

The official agreed to speak Monday only on background because of the sensitive nature of the information. The official said the latest U.S. and NATO view is that both sides essentially remain in their fixed positions -- the rebels near Ajdabiya and the pro-government forces near al-Brega. Rebels say no to African Union-brokered deal . \"Neither side has the wherewithal to move,\" the official said. Rebels do not have the manpower, vehicles or weapons to make major advances. And while Gadhafi's forces continue their attacks, especially in Misrata, the source said they are suffering from a lack of supplies, ammunition and fuel because of airstrikes. The official said that a major ground force movement would put Gadhafi's units in the cross hairs of NATO airstrikes. Airstrikes have rebels clinging to hope . That said, the official acknowledged strongly that the onslaught by Gadhafi forces in Misrata has put people there in a dire situation. The official described a military scenario in which the United States and NATO have direct knowledge of civilians being killed but have been unable to act because Gadhafi forces and armor are so mixed with civilian populations, it's become impossible to launch airstrikes against them. The United States and NATO also think that Gadhafi's forces still have as many as 15,000 shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles, which has resulted in limited use of AC-130 aircraft, which are vulnerable to being shot down as they fly low and slow to engage in the type of precision airstrikes needed in a place like Misrata. The attacks also have affected Gadhafi's ability to communicate with his commanders. He is still having face-to-face meetings with key associates, the official said, but is largely unable to communicate directly with units in the field. There are still some fiber-optic communications capabilities as well as communications nodes in schools and mosques that are very difficult to strike. Report tracks \"sweeping changes\" in Mideast . On the other side, another senior U.S. official who is familiar with administration contacts with the opposition said the opposition's leadership seems to be sincere and earnest about its aim of toppling Gadhafi, but the leaders are not as organized as they need to be. They lack a detailed plan. The rebel military forces and their abilities are \"still a bit of a mystery,\" the officials said. \"... Their resources are limited and their strategies and tactics are hard to fathom.\" While they are holding on to Ajdabiya for the moment, the senior official said it is hard to imagine them making any further gains toward Tripoli.

The 90-year-old Rooney told the Senate Special Committee on Aging that he was abused by a family member who took control of his life, and described feeling \"scared, disappointed, yes, and angry.\" \"You can't believe that it's happening to you,\" Rooney said. \"You feel overwhelmed.\" Rooney has filed a restraining order against his stepson and stepdaughter, claiming both emotional and financial abuse. The committee's hearing brought attention to what experts call chronic elder abuse in America. Rooney said Congress should pass a law to make it a specific crime. \"I'm asking you to stop this elderly abuse. I mean to stop it. Now. Not tomorrow, not next month, but now,\" he shouted from the witness table. Pass legislation and send it to be signed into law by President Barack Obama, he urged, so that the nation can say \"it's a crime and we will not allow it in the United States of America.\" Following the hearing, committee Chairman Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wisconsin, introduced legislation that would create an Office of Elder Justice within the Department of Justice to help coordinate law enforcement response to elder abuse. According to a report by the Government Accountability Office, more than 14% of noninstitutionalized older adults experienced some form of elder abuse in 2009. The report cautions that number may be lower than the reality because many instances of elder abuse are underreported. \"For years I suffered silently. I didn't want to tell anybody. I couldn't muster the courage and you have to have courage,\" Rooney said Wednesday. \"I needed help and I knew I needed it. Even when I tried to speak up, I was told to shut up and be quiet.\" The GAO report found that many Adult Protective Service programs at the state level have growing case loads and dwindling resources. The elder population of the United States is expected to grow by 60% over the next 25 years. Other witnesses detailed the depth of the problem. \"I tell the physicians I train that if they've seen 15 or 20 older people in their practices ... then they have probably met an elder abuse victim, whether they realize it or not,\" said Dr. Mark Lachs, director of geriatrics at the New York Presbyterian Health System. Based on a new study of elder abuse in New York state, \"it would appear that for every elder abuse victim that makes it into an official service or reporting system, another 23 to 24 go undetected,\" Lachs said. Marie-Therese Connolly, director of the group Life Long Justice, told of a man charged by prosecutors in Seattle with murdering his mother. \"His crime? Letting her rot to death with eight huge pressure sores, several to the bone, while he played internet poker and lived off her pension,\" Connolly said. \"His excuse? She didn't want to go to a nursing home or a doctor; he was just respecting her wishes.\" According to Connolly, the woman was \"imprisoned in her bed by immobility, dementia and isolation.\" \"She moaned and cried out for help continuously in the weeks before her death,\" Connolly said. \"Neighbors closed their windows and her son put in earplugs to muffle her cries. No one called Adult Protective Services or 911. It's hard to believe the response would have been the same had the cries come from a child, a younger woman or a dog.\" The witnesses noted that victims of elder abuse put a greater strain on support services by requiring more medical care, housing assistance and other help. Rooney summed up the challenge when he spoke of the personal difficulty that victims of elder abuse face. \"You're afraid, but you're also thinking about your other family members,\" he said, noting concern about potential criticism from \"your family, your friends, people who know them.\" \"They might not want to accept the dysfunction,\" Rooney said, adding that \"one should love their families as I do. I love my family.\" The diminutive Rooney has been a film star for decades, starting with his role in Andy Hardy films in the 1930s.

Colombia's National Police said the four suspects they arrested were part of a criminal network of thieves. Two additional suspects who were allegedly involved in the crime remain on the loose, CNN affiliate Caracol TV reported. The United States will request extradition of the suspects, but it has not yet done so formally, a law enforcement official said. U.S. officials have extradited and prosecuted suspects accused of killing U.S. federal agents in the past. Special Agent James \"Terry\" Watson, assigned to the DEA unit in Cartagena, was on temporary duty in Bogota when he died after being stabbed in a taxi cab last Thursday night, officials said. Authorities have said they do not believe the attack was connected to his work for the U.S. agency. \"The homicide of the DEA agent was committed by common criminals and was not connected to his work in Colombia,\" National Police Director Gen. Jose Roberto Leon Riano said, according to Caracol. U.S. officials praised Colombian authorities Tuesday for their swift investigation. \"The Drug Enforcement Administration is grateful for the outstanding work of the Colombian National Police, the Special Investigative Unit and the Attorney General's Office that led to the swift arrest of these suspects,\" DEA Administrator Michele M. Leonhart said in a written statement. \"We will never forget Special Agent Watson and his sacrifice, as well as all those who have given their lives for the rule of law. We salute the brave and expeditious work of Colombian law enforcement and we look forward to justice being served.\" Watson, 42, had been watching the last game of the NBA finals at a Bogota restaurant Thursday night and left in a taxi, a State Department spokesman said last week. Investigators believe Watson's cab stopped at a traffic light and his assailants jumped out of two other cabs, which pulled up on either side of the vehicle in which he was riding, a law enforcement official said. According to the official, Watson managed to escape from the cab and was taken to a hospital, where he died. In Colombia, such attacks are known as \"millionaire rides.\" Authorities said the suspects they arrested were part of a gang known for millionaire ride robberies. The DEA said Watson was a 13-year veteran of the agency.

After being criticized for defensive play last season, City boss Roberto Mancini has taken the English Premier League by storm with an all-out attacking style. Ivory Coast international Toure, who moved to Eastlands from the Camp Nou in a $38 million deal in July 2010, said that with the current wealth of expensive talent City can rival the European and Spanish champions' free-flowing passing style. The arrival of Sergio Aguero and Samir Nasri has meant City have not missed wantaway former captain Carlos Tevez, while David Silva has blossomed along with Edin Dzeko and Mario Balotelli for the 2011 FA Cup winners. \"Last year was difficult, because some of the media criticized City for defending more than attack,\" Toure said. \"(Now) the boss plays with a different system ... Sami Nasri, Edin Dzeko is playing fantastic now, Aguero, Silva is unbelievable.\" Toure scored the goal that ended City's 35-year wait for a trophy at Wembley in May, and he said that if Mancini's men can maintain the form that has taken them top of the English table then they can be a serious threat to Barca's dominance. \"For me it's important that you have to first win something, and last year we did it. But this year, I think if we continue like that, if we win a couple more cups, maybe we can be like them, because Barcelona is this fantastic machine of football,\" the 28-year-old said. \"I'm full of confidence this year, I think this year is going to be amazing for us.\" City qualified for the Europe's top club competition for the first time since 1969, and have a great chance of progressing into the knockout stage of the Champions League despite being drawn in a so-called \"Group of Death\" along with Bayern Munich, Napoli and Villarreal. \"I think you have to go step by step because for me, for the moment, the Premier League is the most important league,\" Toure said. \"But we focus on the Champions League. \"The Champions League is one of the best competitions in the world, so many great teams there. I think if we get some luck, we can go far.\" Toure will miss a vital chunk of City's season when he heads to Gabon and Equatorial Guinea in January for the month-long African Cup of Nations. The Ivory Coast's \"Elephants,\" drawn in Group B with Burkina Faso, Sudan and Angola, are among the favorites to win the tournament for the first time since 1992, with several of the usual big-name countries not qualifying. Toure's home country is recovering from the civil war that broke out in March after former president Laurent Gbagbo refused to stand down despite losing the November 2010 elections, plus floods that hit Abidjan in June. \"Everybody in my country they are waiting for this cup. And, I think we can only give them the happiness if we win this cup, because the guys from there they need it a lot.\" While Manchester United's status as one of the world's most popular clubs remains intact, Toure's presence at City along with his older brother Kolo has helped change the balance among supporters back home. \"Now I see the fans are very proud to put on the blue shirt of the club,\" he said. \"And now I think the image of City is starting to change. I hope God helps us to continue to win something, which will make a lot of people happy.\"</td><td>Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure says the club can potentially rival Barcelona .\n",

A lack of treated drinking water, coupled with poor hand hygiene and food-preparation practices, make the 1.3 million people still living in camps particularly vulnerable, according to a new study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"The course of the cholera outbreak in Haiti is difficult to predict,\" the report states. \"The Haitian population has no pre-existing immunity to cholera, and environmental conditions in Haiti are favorable for its continued spread.\" Jordan Tappero, a CDC epidemiologist in Haiti, said Haitian authorities and aid agencies are working to limit the epidemic by emphasizing clean water and sanitation. But he added, \"We expect we will be working very hard for many months to come.\" Haiti has not reported a cholera outbreak in more than a century. The current epidemic was first reported in October and has now spread to eight of the Caribbean nation's 10 provinces, the CDC found. Reports linking the outbreak to Nepalese troops from the U.N. peacekeeping mission MINUSTAH sparked riots in the northern port city of Cap-Haitien on Tuesday. A new round of violent protests erupted Thursday in the capital Port-au-Prince, eyewitnesses told CNN. U.N. officials have denied the Nepalese were to blame for the outbreak. The CDC has said the strain of the cholera bacteria responsible is \"indistinguishable\" from one found in other parts of the world, including south Asia, but researchers are unlikely to be able to pinpoint how it arrived in Haiti. \"The reality is that we have a serious problem here,\" CDC spokeswoman Lola Russell said. The emphasis is on controlling the outbreak, \"so that more people do not become ill and potentially die from cholera.\" The epidemic comes as Haiti -- already the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere -- struggles to recover from the January earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people. Even before the quake, only 12 percent of the Haitian population of 9.8 million received treated tap water and only 17 percent had access to adequate sanitation, the CDC noted. \"The water safety and sanitation systems in Haiti were weak be before the earthquake and made weaker by the earthquake, so conditions are ripe for the further spread of cholera,\" Tappero told CNN. Some symptoms of cholera, an acute, bacterial illness caused by drinking tainted water, can be mild or even nonexistent. But the disease can cause profuse watery diarrhea and vomiting, leading to death by rapid dehydration. The heart of the outbreak is the Haitian province of Artibonite, north of Port-au-Prince. Interviews with victims hospitalized in the first days of the outbreak found that two-thirds of them had been drinking untreated water from rivers or canals, the same percentage did not routinely use chlorine to sanitize drinking water and nearly four out of five defecated in the open. And as the current outbreak spreads, infected people could spread the disease further by preparing food without proper hygiene, the CDC reported. \"The way to prevent acquiring cholera when sanitation is poor is to take your water from a clean water source or treat water yourself in the home, and use good sanitary practices with clean water when preparing and cooking food,\" Tappero said.

Action man of climate change: Horn is hoping to inspire a new generation of leaders. During the past eight months the 43-year-old has sailed around the world twice and during a life of exploration, often living on the edge of survival, he has trekked to both poles, sailed solo across oceans and walked across almost every continent. The challenge for Horn now is to find the challenge. Even his first trek to the South Pole earlier this year, a dream he'd had childhood, left him underwhelmed. \"I think it was just an overrated experience,\" he told CNN. \"You were walking to civilization, away from the edge of Antarctica, which is completely wild, to the pole where there's an American base, airplanes landing everyday, red lights telling you if you can cross the runway or not. If I can't satisfy myself walking to the pole and back, let's try and do something else.\" That something else is pursuing a different type of adventure: motivating a new generation to take action to conserve the planet in the face of climate change. Using a specially designed and made 35-meter exploration boat called Pangaea, Horn is showing a lucky few parts of the world unreachable to most. Nearly a year into the four-year Pangaea Expedition, he's been more than encouraged by what he's seen in his \"young explorers\" selected from across the world. \"I haven't been disappointed by one of them. They're not polluted by politics or money. I'm not changing their lives, they're changing them themselves. I'm just taking them to somewhere it's nearly impossible for them to go without the boat, infrastructure and my knowledge,\" he said. It's a knowledge he said he has gained through hard experience; he lost the tips of fingers to frost bite in the Arctic and claims to have narrowly avoided execution at the hands of militia in DR Congo. His desire to preserve nature in a changing world stems from his respect for it. \"To come back alive [from an expedition], you haven't conquered nature, you've just managed to live in harmony with it. That is true competition to me. There's no start or end to it. Adventure becomes a way of living, an inner search of your knowledge,\" he said.  View the gallery of Mike Horn's adventures » . Spirit for adventure . Horn's adventurous spirit manifested itself early. Growing up in South Africa he was given his first bike at age 8 and set off to visit his uncle, not the one 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) away, but the one nearly 300 kilometers away. While his parents encouraged him to explore, a degree in Human Movement Science and honors degree in marketing gave him a greater of a sense of the psychology of competition. Time with the South African military's Special Forces fighting in Angola gave him a harsh lesson in survival and the difference between life and death. And a wife and two children who live in Switzerland remind him not to push it too far on his solo expeditions. Now when choosing the teenagers and young adults to join his expeditions he looks for things in them he saw in himself at that age; a curiosity and enthusiasm similar to his own and that continues to keep him motivated every day. Lecturers join Pangaea's voyages to add some scientific knowledge to Horn's first-hand understanding of the world, and there are ongoing projects for the young explorers to pursue when their time on the boat is over. Yet it is action, not words, that defines Horn. \"I think it's time to act more than anything else. Why discuss global warming and what are we going to do, if we can basically go out and do it?\" he said. \"I don't believe in global warming as such, I believe more in the climate and seasons changing. I'm not a specialist, I'm an adventurer, but maybe I've seen things that other people haven't seen that leads to what I think is a change in climate,\" he said . \"On the North Pole where before there was three to four meters of ice, today the ice breaks up, seals come through and polar bears can hunt there. When you see the big ice shelves break off around Antarctica, you think that there is something happening. I just talk about what I see.\" Action, not words . He's criticized the United Nations as a talking shop and says he has rebuffed advances to become affiliated with them, but has some plans to work with environmental groups, such as the World Wildlife Fund in Indonesia, in the near future. \"Politics slows down a lot. Everyone should have the freedom of speech and with organizations usually you have to keep to the protocol, but there's no protocol when it comes to the world and the future of the planet,\" he said. He's equally tired of adventures or projects that just raise awareness of climate change. \"We have to have a different approach, not that the one I have is completely right, but an approach where you have to build a boat out of plastic bottles... is that something we really must do? It's not enough to just take water samples and say the planet is warming up, or say there is plastic floating in the oceans,\" he said. \"Pangaea\" has some eco-friendly elements. As well as being able to go almost anywhere in the world's oceans, it is made from aluminum, since it is the most recyclable metal and is unpainted to reduce pollution from noxious paints usually found on ships. Part powered by solar, the crew is able to make its own water onboard and there is a plastic compactor for all the trash the boat trawls out of the oceans. Horn's single-mindedness has also secured lucrative partnerships with some big-name brands that bankroll his missions. Mercedes Benz are contracted to change Pangaea's engines every year with the most efficient model; next year they will get one with zero CO2 emissions. \"It gives them something to work on and me an opportunity to stay with my philosophy. There are some [companies] that don't give a s**t; you mustn't preach to the converted. That's why it's important to get companies involved that might change their mindset.\" Horn is positive that he can make a difference through educating his young charges and the problems many fear are impossible to solve, can be dealt with. \"I came back after the expedition around the Arctic and the North Pole and I saw 'An Inconvenient Truth' and I thought, 'It's not that bad.' The world is still a beautiful place.

The immigration debate is reflected in a number of policies and proposals, most recognizably state immigration laws that are being challenged. Oral arguments are scheduled at the Supreme Court on Wednesday as the justices decide whether Arizona can enforce its controversial immigration law. A bill in Mississippi that would require police to check the immigration status of all those arrested died in the state Senate this month. Amid the backdrop of contentious debates comes a study this week from the Pew Hispanic Center, which finds that for the first time in decades, the flow of Mexican migrants to and from the United States balances out. The effect may be even more pronounced. According to the report, \"the trend lines ... suggest that return flow to Mexico probably exceeded the inflow from Mexico during the past year or two.\" \"The largest wave of immigration in history from a single country to the United States has come to a standstill,\" the report announces. The report's findings weren't a surprise to several Mexican immigrants in Los Angeles, who said they've seen the political and economic situation shift dramatically in recent years. \"It isn't like it was before. The laws have changed. The work is very hard. Life is very expensive,\" said Norma Ibarra. \"It's not the United States it was 30 years ago.\" Alba Roche said her nieces in Mexico want to come to the United States, but can't. \"They haven't been able to come because of the situation, because there is not enough work, and more than anything because crossing is quite dangerous, so there are many obstacles,\" she said. Those who study immigration trends and policy agree that the apparent standstill in immigration is significant, but to varying degrees they say it will do little to change attitudes and actions in the United States. Jeffrey Passel, senior demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center and one of the report's authors, said that as Mexican families have fewer children, the number of potential immigrants is shrinking. Also, the Mexican economy is improving and providing jobs that before weren't available and provided a push to look for opportunities in the United States. \"It's likely impossible that we'll get back to the level of immigration that we saw 10 years ago. It's possible that the flows may pick up, but I don't think they will get anywhere near where they were in 2000,\" Passel said. \"People have been talking about the return flow for a couple of years, but it just wasn't showing up in the data, and now we're beginning to see it,\" he added. But the forces that pull immigrants to the United States and push them from Mexico have not disappeared. \"It's a little premature to say that part of history is over,\" said Tamar Jacoby, president and CEO of ImmigrationWorks USA, a federation of small-business owners in favor of immigration reform. There are a number of factors that may have affected the recent trend: better enforcement in the United States, demographic changes in Mexico and the economic downturn in the United States. \"We have three different reasons, and we don't know how important each one of these reasons is,\" she said. As those factors shift -- for example, as the U.S. economy improves -- the demand for immigrant workers in the United States will rise, she said. An improving situation in Mexico could result in fewer Mexicans migrating to the United States, but people from Central American countries could fill that void. Even if not as large as before, a future demand for immigrants in the United States will mean a continuation of the debates of today. The news produced in the Pew Hispanic report may relieve some people's anxieties, but for many illegal immigration critics, the real problem isn't the immigrants arriving today but the cumulative effects of immigrants who have arrived illegally over the past 30 years, Jacoby said. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, said there is no question that immigration from Mexico has slowed, but it doesn't mean nobody is coming. \"The claim that this is a permanent development is premature,\" said Krikorian, whose center favors a restrictive approach to immigration policy. \"When our economy picks up, what happens then?\" he asked. Krikorian said he sees the pause in Mexican migration as an opportunity to build up enforcement against future illegal immigration. \"The conclusion I draw from this is that we have breathing space to put enforcement measures in place that we will need when these pressures mount again,\" he said.

But Amanda Knox immediately knew it was the one for her. The University of Washington student had been in Perugia for just a few hours on a hot summer day in 2007 with her younger sister, Deanna, who saw a poster that included the word \"appartamento.\" They followed the girl who had posted the ad to a charming, four-bedroom villa near the University for Foreigners of Perugia overlooking a small valley where figs grew. The sisters chatted for hours in the kitchen with the two friendly Italian girls who lived there and made plans with them to tour the town the next day. To the wanderlust-driven young American, who had been hitting the books hard and working multiple jobs since high school so she could study abroad, it was a dream come true. \"She didn't need to see any other place, she didn't need to see any other listings, she was set,\" says her sister. British exchange student Meredith Kercher moved into the house shortly after Knox settled in. The two foreigners became fast friends, Knox's friends and family say, as they explored Perugia together. None of them had any way of knowing that just weeks later, the home would be the scene of a grisly stabbing that would leave Kercher dead and Knox branded her cold-blooded killer. Prosecutors in Perugia said Knox directed then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito and another man infatuated with her, Rudy Guede, to hold Kercher down as Knox played with a knife before slashing Kercher's throat. Knox and Sollecito were convicted in 2009. Knox was sentenced to 26 years in prison and Sollecito is serving a 25-year sentence. Guede, a drifter originally from the Ivory Coast, was tried separately and is serving a 16-year sentence. Knox and Sollecito are awaiting a ruling on their appeal against conviction. Media paints two portraits of Knox . The sordid saga has played out in worldwide media long enough to have broken into dual narratives. Some journalists have portrayed Knox as an overly trusting college student who some believe was railroaded by the Italian justice system. Other media paint her as a licentious, manipulative young American still trying to get away with murder, despite an alleged confession, which she quickly recanted, and a conviction. To Knox's friends and family, it's a no-brainer. They grimace at the description prosecutors painted of Knox as a resentful American so angry with Kercher that she exacted revenge during a twisted sexual misadventure. Nothing in her past indicated she had the desire or capacity to kill anyone, let alone a friend, they say. One friend told CNN she was the kind of person who would pick up a spider and take it outside rather than kill it. More than anything, they say, her life had been all about immersing herself in new experiences and creating opportunities to travel abroad. Easy daughter . Growing up in Seattle, Washington, Knox was an easy daughter from the start, says Edda Mellas, Knox's mother. She was a child who never had to be told to do her homework or go to bed on time. She maintained a balance between a life indoors, where she studied regularly and read for pleasure, and a passion for outdoor activities and sports, in particular gymnastics and soccer. Knox's desire to study foreign languages and experience different cultures also became apparent early on, Mellas says. She took Latin in middle school and began expressing a desire to travel abroad. Even though her parents told her they couldn't afford a private high school, she applied on her own and was accepted with a substantial scholarship. She learned Japanese in high school and spent time in Japan as part of her studies, her mother says. \"She loved learning languages. She thought about being an interpreter. She really wanted to be a writer and I said, 'Maybe you need to get a day job while you're trying to make money being a writer.' And then she thought about being an interpreter. Languages were definitely her kind of gift.\" In 2004, her mother took her daughters to Europe. They visited family in Austria and spent Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany. \"They just loved seeing the history and the culture and differences in people. And it was a great experience,\" Mellas said. Knox eventually turned her sights to studying abroad in college. She rejected soccer scholarships from several schools because she knew she would have to commit to the sports program. So again, she set her sights on a longshot: the highly competitive University of Washington. She got in and made a positive first impression on practically everyone she met, says friend Andrew Seliber, who testified at her trial as a character witness. \"I think it was her just open personality to, you know, see the good things in people and have always a positive attitude about everybody and everything in the world.  And it was really refreshing coming to school and meeting people like that, especially like her, who were, you know, so willing to see everybody's perspectives about, you know, anything.\" Seliber adds she worked hard to keep up her GPA, making the dean's list almost every quarter, so she could travel her junior year. \"I think (studying abroad) was kind of an extension of that personality where she always wanted to meet people and -- and just get their perspectives on the world, because there's really no better way of opening yourself up than to travel the world,\" Seliber says. She considered Germany, Austria and Scotland, her mother says, before deciding on Italy, a place she'd never been and where the people spoke a language she hadn't studied. \"She wanted to try something different,\" Mellas says. \"Once she decided on Italy, she thought about going to the really typical places: Florence or Rome. But she really thought that to her seemed more touristy. And she wanted just everyday, small-town, regular Italians and not where there would be hundreds of English-speaking people. She wanted to immerse herself in a smaller town and -- she looked around and Perugia had a program.\" Mellas worried about her but took comfort in the fact that she would be close to relatives in Europe. \"You worry if you send your kids that far away. But it was also a dream of hers that you know, nobody was going to squash. I worried that she was too trusting. I worried that she didn't have enough self-preservation kind of instincts.\" European adventure . Knox worked in two coffee shops and an art gallery, living frugally to save the $10,000 she would need for the trip. Finally, the time arrived for her to begin her adventure in August 2007. She and her sister went to Europe to visit relatives before catching a train to Perugia. From the start, it was an adventure, her sister says. \"We showed up in Perugia on the train and just thought we could find our way to her hotel, and realized that we had no idea where we were going. So we ended up hiking with our backpacks like, five miles right off the train station to even find a bus that would take us to our hotel,\" Deanna Knox says. As soon as they arrived, Knox made her way to the University for Foreigners of Perugia to get the lay of the land. \"The city was really beautiful. You could really tell on Amanda's face and how she was acting that she was instantly in love.\" After school began, Knox sent enthusiastic e-mails to her family nearly every day. She described attending a chocolate festival and a book fair with Kercher. A few weeks into her stay, she wrote in various e-mails that she had met a handsome computer engineering student who looked like Harry Potter at a classical music concert. Knox had been a \"late bloomer\" in terms of dating, so news that she had met Raffaele Sollecito made her sister happy. \"She was just infatuated with the whole idea of him. First of all, he was a foreign guy, he was sweet, he was really kind, he was smart. ... He was exactly my sister's type.\" Deanna Knox says. \"It was pretty exciting. I wanted to learn more about him, and it just happened that they were only dating for two weeks before everything happened. I wish -- I really wish that they could've gotten to know each other a lot better.\" CNN's Mallory Simon and Todd Schwarzschild contributed to this report.</td><td>Friends, family: Nothing about Amanda Knox's past suggests she's a killer .\n",

She's charged with violating her parole in a truancy case because three of her younger children have missed hundreds of days of school combined. While students have always suffered the consequences of playing hooky, parents in DeKalb County, Georgia, are facing one of the more aggressive anti-truancy programs in the country, one where punishment can include time behind bars. DeKalb's program is one of a growing list targeting truancy in U.S. schools, said Jodi Heilbrunn, senior research and policy analyst at The National Center for School Engagement. \"Ten years ago, there weren't too many anti-truancy programs, but now they are springing up like rabbits,\" Heilbrunn said, and \"they come in many varieties.\" In some communities, a single school takes on its own problem. In others, like Jacksonville, Florida, and Niagara Falls, New York, the battle is system wide. And New Jersey is about to institute a statewide system, targeting six cities with the worst truancy problems. The DeKalb County program, started in May 2006, was designed to get children from the age of 6 to 16 back in class. If a child has 10 or more unexcused absences from school, parents are referred to an intervention program where they sign a contract agreeing to make sure their children get to class. If they fail to do that, they face the judge. According the county solicitor general's office, around 300 families have gone to court so far.  Watch how a Georgia mother ends up in handcuffs » . Most of the parents who are cited are charged with educational neglect, said DeKalb County Solicitor-General Robert James. Most of those charged plead guilty and get probation, he said. The probation usually involves parenting classes, counseling, and follow-up visits for progress and attendance reports. Parents who violate their probation run the risk of thousands of dollars in fines, and up to 30 days in jail per count. \"We are putting parents in jail, or we are bringing them in orange jumpsuits not just because their children are not in school, but because they got a subpoena or summons to come to court, or to come to a diversionary program and they refused to do so. So this is more about accountability than anything,\" James said. James said it is critical in his county to keep kids in school. The Georgia Department of Corrections found that more than 60 percent of its inmates in 2007 didn't earn a high school diploma, and James quoted an internal survey that found 84 percent of inmates in DeKalb County's jail are high school dropouts. LaTara Tankersley-Jones and Craig Scott, investigators for the DeKalb County Solicitor-General's office, are tasked with locating \"truant\" parents and serving court-ordered summons. Jones and Scott, usually with assistance from local law enforcement, also must arrest parents who have not complied with a court-ordered probation or failed to show up to court in the first place. Scott said arrest is the least desirable option, but \"the bottom line is, we have a warrant and even if the children are there, you're going to have to come with us.\" Robinson was no stranger to the investigators. The county had intervened on behalf of her children before, even providing Thanksgiving dinner and Christmas presents last year. The mother had been ordered to be sure her children went to school and to attend parenting classes herself. She had done neither, investigators said, earning herself a night in jail and a face-to-face with the judge the next day. Judge R. Joy Walker presides over the Educational Neglect courtroom. On a recent Friday in October, she handled each of the 80 or so cases before her in a fast, firm, and efficient manner. One by one, each parent, mostly women, has an opportunity to explain to Walker why they are in her courtroom. Investigators Jones and Scott are there as well. They say they hear the same excuses over and over again. \"They can't get up, or they have so many things that are going on in their life that are preventing them from making sure that their kids go to school,\" Jones said. Walker agrees to probation for most of the parents in her court this day, including Angela Harris, who pleads guilty to 24 counts, one for each of the 24 days her child missed school. \"I have never in my 48 years been in trouble, so this is all new to me,\" she tells the judge. \"The state is offering you 24 months (of probation), but if you mess up I'm going to put you in jail,\" Walker replies. Walker has put 15 \"truant\" parents behind bars. Lajuana Robinson is released. But she'll have to return to court another day to explain why her children aren't in school. So far, the success of the DeKalb program has been limited. \"We have seen some small results,\" James said. Attendance has increased by 2 to 3 percent over the past year. \"I am not satisfied by that, but in a school system of over 100,000 kids, you are talking about 2,000  to 3,000 more children attending school than what we had the year before last,\" he said. James says that he has received some interest from neighboring counties about the program and he thinks it is only a matter of time before they adopt similar ones. \"We have a lot of parents who feel we should not be intervening in family business, but it's the law.

The defense authorization bill passed by a vote of 93-7. In keeping with budget cuts across the government, the $662 billion bill shrinks Pentagon spending by $43 billion from last year. It includes funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and sets policies for the various weapons systems and personnel programs at the Defense Department. Senate debate on the detainee matter was at times volatile and emotional. After years of struggling with issues of who should investigate, detain and try suspected terrorists -- civilian authorities and courts or the military and its tribunal system -- Armed Services Committee Chair Carl Levin, D-Michigan, and ranking Republican John McCain of Arizona reached a long-sought compromise to codify the process. However, critics complained the deal was weighted toward the military because it required any suspected al Qaeda terrorists, even those captured inside the U.S., to be held potentially indefinitely by the military. That concerned the White House and many lawmakers who think the responsibility belongs, in part, to law enforcement agencies and the federal courts and warned that Americans could possibly be detained indefinitely by the military. Levin and McCain denied their bill would allow for the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens. \"This country is special because we have certain values, and due process of law is one of those values,\" Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, D-California, argued on the Senate floor. \"I object to holding American citizens without trial. I do not believe that makes us more safe.\" \"You have people on the left who hate saying 'the war on terror,'\" responded Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina. \"They would never ever use the military and always insist the law enforcement be used because they don't buy into the idea that we're at war. They want to criminalize the war.\" Senators ultimately reached an agreement to amend the bill to make clear it's not the bill's intent to allow for the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens and others legally residing in the country. \"It would provide the assurance that we are not adversely affecting the rights of American citizens in this language,\" Levin said while expressing support for the compromise. \"It supports present law,\" Feinstein added. Senators from both parties also challenged the Obama administration's policies toward Iran, unanimously approving an amendment insisting on tough new sanctions against Iran's Central Bank and entities that do business with it. Senators want to punish Iran over its pursuit of a nuclear weapons programs and the recent storming of the British Embassy in Tehran. The administration complained the Senate amendment would make it difficult for the White House to manage a delicate foreign policy matter. Also Thursday, the Senate approved on a voice vote a Democratic amendment requiring President Barack Obama to develop a plan to expedite the troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, which is scheduled to be completed in 2014. While it's not clear the amendment will force any actual acceleration of the withdrawal, Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, said the Senate vote was a \"message\" to the president that U.S. troops have successfully performed their mission of stamping out al Qaeda and the 9-11 terrorists and \"it's time to bring our men and women home.\" The measure still needs to go to conference for reconciliation with the House version of the bill.</td><td>Defense authorization bill passes Senate in 93-7 vote .\n",

A car bomb killed Brig. Gen. Wissam al-Hassan and two others Friday, 30 minutes before he was to meet with Lebanese lawmaker Amar Houri to discuss a threatening text message sent to the lawmaker from a Syrian phone number, according to parliamentarian Ahmad Fatfat. Similar threats had been sent via text message to three other lawmakers, including Fatfat, although they did not realize it until after al-Hassan's assassination, Fatfat said. All four are members of Lebanon's Future Movement, the largest member of the vocally anti-Syrian March 14 political coalition led by Saad Hariri. After al-Hassan's assassination, Fatfat said he and his colleagues received another text from a similar phone number threatening further killings: \"Congratulations, the countdown has started,\" the text read. \"One of ten.\" Al-Hassan, who was killed along with a bodyguard and a bystander, was an icon among many fellow Sunni Muslims -- including those aligned with Hariri's opposition coalition -- for his leadership and efforts in rooting out those responsible for targeted killings in Lebanon. But as much as he was loved by some, he angered others -- especially those backing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and many affiliated with Hezbollah, the Shiite militant and political movement that has a prominent role in Lebanon's government. The U.S. government labels it a terrorist organization. However, Hezbollah is widely popular with many of Lebanon's Shiite Muslims. Al-Hassan: A polarizing figure . The lawmakers had told al-Hassan about the threatening texts they had received before Friday's attack, and al-Hassan had agreed to meet with one of them Friday to discuss the details. U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Monday that an FBI team will be sent to Lebanon to assist in the investigation into al-Hassan's death. Since the assassination, sporadic fighting has erupted across Lebanon, threatening to plunge the country into chaos and raising fears that it could be drawn into the bloody 19-month-old civil war in neighboring Syria. After al-Hassan's funeral Sunday, angry protesters clashed with security forces and rushed toward the prime minister's office, calling for his dismissal. By midday Monday, at least three people had been killed in the northern city of Tripoli, while another person was killed in the southern city of Sidon, and another killed in Beirut, Lebanon's official National News Agency reported. More than two dozen people were injured nationwide. Amid the unrest, the youth wing of the March 14 coalition called for a peaceful rally in Beirut's Martyrs' Square on Monday evening. The March 14 movement is an anti-Syrian coalition that emerged after the 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. His son, Saad, leads the coalition. Key players in Lebanon's latest crisis . Syria has condemned the attack but that hasn't stopped accusations it is behind Friday's killing, which marked the country's highest-profile assassination in more than seven years. The United States has also condemned the attack and vowed to assist in investigating the bombing. CNN's Saad Abedine contributed to this report.</td><td>NEW: An FBI team is en route to Lebanon .\n",

The I-9 form is an employment eligibility document meant to determine a person's ability to work legally in the United States. \"At the end of the day, the goal is to ensure that the companies have an authorized, legal workforce and also that employers are aware of their responsibility to ensure the people they hire are lawful,\" the official said. The I-9 strategy is believed to be a more effective use of the agency's investigative resources, putting the onus on the audited company to take corrective action, the official added. Chipotle has \"done what ICE has asked of us and are looking to put that incident behind us,\" Arnold said. The crackdown coincides with recent judiciary hearings in Arizona in which lawmakers debated proposals to end birthright citizenship for U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants. Nearly one-third of America's 38 million immigrants are illegal, just under four percent of the total U.S. population, according to recent reports from the Pew Hispanic Research Center and the Brookings Institute, a Washington-based think tank. Of those, many are employed in low-wage restaurants jobs. But analysts debate the broader economic impact of illegal immigration in the United States. Critics often blame the large undocumented workforce for siphoning public resources while forcing a drop in wages or displacing low-skilled U.S.-born workers. Advocates say consumers benefit from lower prices as a result of the lower wages paid to illegal workers, arguing that they fill unskilled labor gaps and create work opportunities for higher-skilled, higher-paid workers who are often native born. Illegal immigration \"nationally, doesn't seem to make a significant difference\" to the broader U.S. economy, said Audrey Singer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute who studies U.S. immigration policy. \"The real impact is at local levels,\" Singer said, pointing to state and local law enforcement, schools and health care systems that pay for an undocumented workforce that may or may not contribute tax revenue for services rendered. But as record unemployment rates affect cities and towns across the country, immigrants -- particularly illegal immigrants -- are being targeted, she said.

Recently, however, the city proved that its penchant for the extra large isn't limited to the inanimate. Last week, the Dubai Mall became home to a giant pacific octopus -- the largest species of octopus on the planet. The newest occupant, who lives at the mall's Dubai Aquarium & Underwater Zoo, stretches out to a fear-inducing 14 feet, and weighs over 70 kilograms (154 pounds). Earlier this month, the aquarium announced it had acquired one of the largest known reptiles on the planet, a 1,600-pound crocodile they've dubbed King Croc (they also flew in his companion, Queen Croc). John Gerner, a theme park consultant and the managing director at Leisure Business Advisors, notes that the mall's current preoccupation with large animals is consistent with the Emirate's obsession with record-breaking pursuits. \"In a general, entertainment attractions have always been a way for countries to have bragging rights in the world. By having the best, the biggest and the fastest of everything, Dubai wants to show they've arrived on the world stage. In many ways, having record-breaking animals is another way to do that,\" he says. The country is no stranger to peppering its entertainment offerings with animals exotic to the region. In 2012, Ski Dubai -- the indoor ski slope housed at Mall of the Emirates -- welcomed a colony of King and Gentoo penguins. In 2008, Atlantis, The Palm hotel courted controversy from animal rights groups when it hosted a whale shark in its in-built aquarium. \"Lately, you're seeing attractions where you wouldn't typically find animals adding them in. It's a merging of concepts. At Atlantis, you have a lodging using an animal attraction as an amenity to justify higher room rates and occupancy,\" explains Gerner. It's a concept that doesn't sit well with local animal rights groups. \"In the wild, crocodiles spent hours swimming and can regulate the buoyancy and temperature or their bodies. No enclosure -- no matter how large -- is able to provide crocodiles with everything that is natural and important to them,\" says Ashley Fruno, the Asia and Middle East senior campaigner for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). \"If the Dubai Mall wants to set itself apart from the rest, there are other ways to do that than imprisoning wild animals in concrete enclosures and taking away everything that is natural and important to them,\" she adds. In a statement, Emaar, the developers for The Dubai Mall, note that King Croc and his companion were obtained from a crocodile farm in Australia. They add that the transfer was facilitated in partnership with Australian government authorities, who reviewed the quality of the display, qualifications of the staff caring for the animals and the educational purpose of the exhibit. Emaar also notes that the habitat made for the two crocodiles is three times the size specified by the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums. The country's fascination with wild animals isn't always limited to the indoors. Last year the UAE's Ministry of Environment and Water issued bans on the commercial and personal import of a variety of exotic animals -- including many big cats and primates -- yet they remain popular pets for many Emiratis, who see them as a status symbol. Several locals have shot to Instagram fame showcasing their exotic animal collection. \"Unfortunately, the trade in exotic animals is largely unregulated and statistics are very difficult to come by,\" says Fruno. \"The animals pay the price for this trade. Many don't survive the journey from their homes in the wild, and those that do often die prematurely from malnutrition, an unnatural environment, loneliness and the overwhelming stress of confinement.\" Still, she does note that animal rights -- though a newer concept in the UAE -- is on the rise. \"Awareness is growing by the day, and new animal welfare groups are popping up in the region all the time,\" she says.</td><td>The Dubai Mall recently acquired a giant squid and two crocodiles .\n",

She was 75. Lauder died from complications of ovarian cancer at her home with her family by her side, the company said.

Buying a new CD? Maybe every now and then. But the most popular way today's teens discover music is through clicking around on YouTube. That's the finding of a new study by media research firm Nielsen. Its Music 360 report set out to learn how music is found, purchased and consumed. Among all adults, radio remains the most popular tool, with 48 percent saying that's how they usually discover their new jams. Young listeners opting to stream, not own music . But more teens, 64 percent, cited YouTube, the Web's leading video-sharing site, as a place where they listen to music. Followed by radio (56%), iTunes (53% ) and CDs (50%). The popularity of YouTube is dramatically higher among teens than all adults. Only 7 percent of all respondents said they discover music most frequently through the site. Strangely, the report doesn't address teens' listening habits on music-streaming sites such as Pandora, Spotify or Grooveshark. \"The accessibility of music has seen tremendous expansion and diversification,\" said David Bakula, a Nielsen senior vice president. \"While younger listeners opt for technologically advanced methods , traditional methods of discovery like radio and word-of-mouth continue to be strong drivers.\" The study also shows the changing landscape of music sales. Just over one in three teens (36 percent) said they'd bought a CD in the past year, while more than half (51 percent) said they'd paid to download at least one song. The report came from an online survey of 3,000 people in the United States. Among all respondents, finding new music still relies upon a mix of new media and more traditional means. In addition to the 48 percent who favor radio, 10 percent said they rely on friends or relatives for suggestions. But more than half (54 percent) said those personal recommendations make them more likely to make a purchase. YouTube, which is owned by Google, claims more than 800 million unique visitors every month.

For many rugby union players the ultimate accomplishment is being selected to appear for the famed British Lions on their overseas tours. Giant Munster lock Paul O'Connell is leading the 2009 Lions in South Africa. The Lions are comprised of the best players from the four home unions of England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland and competition for places in the squad is fierce as club and country loyalties are put aside. In the modern professional era, Lions tours take place every four years, visiting the southern-hemisphere Tri-Nations powers of New Zealand, South Africa and Australia in rotation. A typical tour will see a series of matches against provincial or regional sides, interspersed with international or Test matches. Midweek fixtures are normally against weaker teams, with the Lions giving all their squad members a chance to play, with stronger opposition for the weekend matches which would include the Tests. The 2009 Lions are touring world champions South Africa, looking to improve on the dismal performance of the 2005 side, which visited New Zealand. Under England's 2003 World Cup winning coach Clive Woodward, the 2005 squad were expected to prosper, but slipped to defeat in all three Test matches against the All Blacks. The team was captained by Brian O'Driscoll, but his tour ended after just two minutes of the first Test when he was controversially 'spear' tackled by Tana Umaga and Keven Mealamu and dislocated his shoulder. O'Driscoll, who led Ireland to the Six Nations Grand Slam this year, was expected to captain the Lions to South Africa, but coach Ian McGeechan gave the job to Munster lock Paul O'Connell. McGeechan has already gone into Lions history, playing on the 1974 and 1977 tours, and coaching winning teams to Australia and South Africa in 1989 and 1997. He also took them to New Zealand in 1993 where the Test series was lost 2-1. The Lions enjoyed their most successful period in the early 1970s with the 1971 team -- inspired by the Welsh half-back pairing of Gareth Edwards and Barry John -- triumphing against the All Blacks in New Zealand. The 1974 Lions were arguably the best-known and most successful of all time, winning three Tests and drawing one in South Africa and going through the tour unbeaten. Under Irish captain Willie John McBride, their uncompromising forward play set up the victories, with their now infamous catch phrase \"get your retaliation in first\" leading to brutal early exchanges in most games. The modern era is a far cry from the first Lions tour back in 1888 which visited Australia and New Zealand with just 21 players from England, Scotland and Wales. They played provincial and local sides without formal Test matches. But it had established a precedent, and the 1891 side was sanctioned by the sport's ruling body the Rugby Football Union (RFU) and played three Tests against South Africa. The 1924 tour to South Africa was the first trip when the term \"the Lions\" became common currency and it has grown from strength to strength since, despite the growing influence of international rugby competitions such as the Tri and Six Nations and the World Cup.</td><td>British and Irish Lions are selected from England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland .\n",

The released cited a string of such attacks, including a blast last September that killed at least 54 people at a rally in Quetta and a car bombing the same month that killed at least 17 people -- including four children -- in Lakki Marwat. Even among militant groups known for brutal violence, Qari Hussain Mehsud has a notorious reputation. He is alleged to have recruited dozens of Pakistani children as suicide bombers (a form of attack in which he reportedly is an expert trainer) and has boasted of personally beheading enemies. After the abortive Times Square bombing in New York last year, his voice was purportedly on the audio tape that claimed responsibility for the attack on behalf of the TTP. On several occasions, Pakistani officials have claimed that he has been killed. No evidence has ever been presented, and it seems that Qari Hussain is still somewhere in the rugged mountains along the Afghan-Pakistan border -- most likely in North Waziristan. He is well connected in jihadist circles. He is a cousin of the current leader of the TTP, Hakimullah Mehsud (himself a target of US drone attacks), and terrorism analysts believe he has good contacts with other groups active in the region. Not that those contacts have always been cordial -- Pakistani media reported in 2008 a feud over the fate of a Polish geologist who was being held by Qari Hussain's group. Rather than hand him over to another faction, they slit his throat. Qari Hussein comes from the Mehsud tribe, which is prominent in Waziristan and includes several other leading figures in the Pakistan Taliban. But he also spent time as a boy in Karachi, attending a hard-line Sunni \"madrassa\" or religious school. A Pakistani journalist, Tahir Ali, wrote last year of a meeting with Qari Hussain, who claimed to have been active in militant groups since boyhood. Ali quoted him as saying: \"I was very young when I joined Lashkar i Jhangvi and actively took part in anti-Shia activities; I also remained for a short time with Ilyas Kashmiri group ... later on I focused on jihad in Waziristan.\" Both Lashkar and the Ilyas Kashmiri group are militant anti-Shia groups involved in terrorism in Pakistan and Indian Kashmir. Ilyas Kashmiri has repeatedly threatened to export terror attacks to Europe. According to Ali, he also claimed to be just 22 years of age. Others who have met him say that Qari Hussein appears to be in his early 40s. In January 2008, the Pakistani army launched \"Operation Zalzala\" against a Mehsud stronghold in South Waziristan. While many Taliban fighters were killed and his house was destroyed, Qari Hussain escaped. But Pakistani forces uncovered a \"school\" that he is said to have run for child suicide bombers, along with videos of classes. Pakistani Maj. Gen. Tariq Khan described the school as \"like a factory\" which had been turning 9- to 12-year old boys into suicide bombers. The U.S. State Department's designation of Qari Hussain Hussain says he \"has gained particular notoriety for his heavy recruitment of children.\" Undaunted, Qari Hussain shifted his operations to North Waziristan and later released a 40-minute video in which teenagers and young men declared their intent to become suicide bombers. By this time, he was the commander of Fidayeen-e-Islam, a group within the Pakistani Taliban that specialized in suicide bombings. These were aimed at the Pakistani state and military, and included attacks on federal and police offices in Lahore. But they were also aimed at Pakistan's Shia minority. A Shia procession in Lahore in September 2010 was attacked by a Taliban suicide bomber, who killed 33 people. The number of suicide attacks rose dramatically between 2007 and 2010, and most were blamed on or claimed by the Pakistani Taliban. It was in May 2010 that the Pakistan Taliban was linked to its first attempted attack in the U.S. Faisal Shahzad attempted to leave a car bomb in New York's Times Square. It failed to go off, but an audio tape released hours later purported to feature the voice of Qari Hussein in claiming that \"the recent attack\" was in response to American \"interference and terrorism in Muslim countries, especially in Pakistan.\" It's not known whether Qari Hussain met or trained Shahzad, but it seems likely that he was involved in the suicide bombing of the CIA base in Khost, Afghanistan, at the end of 2009. Before the attack, the suicide bomber recorded a video with Hakimullah Mehsud, and as the Pakistani Taliban's expert trainer of suicide bombers, Qari Hussain likely helped him prepare for the mission. In its designation, the U.S. State Department says \"Hussain is believed to have trained the Jordanian militant Humam Muhammad Abu Mulal al-Balawi\" who carried out the Khost attack, killing seven U.S. citizens. The Pakistani government has declared a reward of 50 million rupees ($600,000) for his capture, but Qari Hussain has evaded both capture and the much-expanded U.S. drone campaign. The U.S. action against Qari Hussain blocks all property \"subject to U.S. jurisdiction in which Hussain has an interest\" and prohibits all transactions by U.S. persons with Hussain. Given his record so far, it is unlikely to have much impact on his role within the Pakistani Taliban.</td><td>Qari Hussain Mehsud's notoriety includes allegedly training children as suicide bombers .\n",

I have terrible marks now.\" Mary's story is similar to hundreds of thousands of women's experiences in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, where rape is routinely \"deployed\" as a weapon of war by the armed groups fighting over a nation that has some of the richest nonpetroleum natural resource deposits in the world. Congo holds the numbing distinction of being home to the deadliest war in the world since World War II -- with more than 5.4 million people killed during the past 15 years. \"This war is caused by the minerals,\" Mary told us. \"Those [armed groups] control the minerals. I hear that they are used in mobile phones. ... If you talk to Obama or the phone companies, tell them what happens here.\" Armed groups in eastern Congo that control minerals, mines and trading routes generate an estimated $180 million each year by trading four main minerals: tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold. This money enables the armed groups to purchase large numbers of weapons and continue their campaign of brutal violence against civilians. Conflict minerals are key components in the manufacture of cell phones, laptops, digital cameras, video games and portable music players. Because of increasing awareness of the links between electronics products and the worst sexual violence in the world, change is afoot. During U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's visit to eastern Congo in August, she said: \"With respect to companies that are responsible for what are now being called conflict minerals, I think the international community must start looking at steps we can take to try to prevent the mineral wealth from the DRC ending up in the hands of those who fund the violence here.\" The U.S. Congress has also initiated a strong bipartisan effort to curb the conflict minerals trade. Senate and House bills on this issue represent a significant step toward having conflict-free cell phones and laptops by setting up a system of audits and minerals-tracing mechanisms. This would reveal which phones and laptops contain conflict minerals and which ones do not. Introduced by Sens. Sam Brownback (R-Kansas), Russ Feingold (D-Wisconsin) and Dick Durbin (D-Illinois) on the Senate side, and Reps. Jim McDermott (D-Washington), Frank Wolf (R-Virginia), Barney Frank (D-Massachusetts) and Donald Payne (D-New Jersey) on the House side, the bills already have the support of powerful committee chairmen but still must be moved through committee. With the Obama administration and Congress taking a strong interest in this issue, and activist campaigning building some momentum, companies have begun to react. The tin industry has gone the furthest by introducing an initiative to increase due diligence and trace minerals on the ground in Congo. Electronics companies also have a project under way to map out supply chains. And Intel, HP, Dell, and Motorola are hosting a meeting with activists on conflict minerals in San Francisco, California, this month. But it is not enough. Campus activists -- from New York; to Knoxville, Tennessee; to Nevada -- are taking up this issue with increased vigor, along with major faith-based groups, from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops to Jewish World Watch. Are the government and company actions taken to date enough to stop the conflict minerals trade from continuing? The answer is no. Electronics companies must invest in a system to certify that the minerals used in their products are verifiably conflict-free. They must work with their suppliers to trace the minerals back to their mines of origin and have independent audits conducted of these supply chains so that we know with verified proof that none has passed through the hands of armed groups. The Obama administration should help companies develop a certification process for conflict minerals, built on the lessons of the Kimberley Process for blood diamonds. The administration can also help devise a public-private partnership to work with companies, the Congolese government and other key donor countries to help miners in eastern Congo and improve mining inspection and tracing on the ground. Companies and the government can take steps today. For a start, electronics companies should have audits conducted of their supply chains for the minerals. And Congress should pass the conflict minerals legislation, to get tracing started. If you have a cell phone, you can also have an impact. Ask your senator and representative to sign the Congo Conflict Minerals Act (S. 891) and Conflict Minerals Trade Act (H.R. 4128), and find a creative way to reach your cell phone manufacturer to tell it you want a conflict-free cell phone. The minerals supply chain involves multiple companies, and the war in Congo will not be resolved overnight. But if companies and consumers take a stand and say \"Give us conflict-free products,\" we can stop this deadly trade and put real pressure on the armed groups that rape women on a mass scale in eastern Congo.

To answer that question, take this brief quiz. Over the past two decades, what have the U.S. trends been for the following important measures of social health: high school dropout rates, college enrollment, juvenile crime, drunken driving, traffic deaths, infant mortality, life expectancy, per capita gasoline consumption, workplace injuries, air pollution, divorce, male-female wage equality, charitable giving, voter turnout, per capita GDP and teen pregnancy? The answer for all of them is the same: The trend is positive. Almost all those varied metrics of social wellness have improved by more than 20% over the past two decades. And that's not counting the myriad small wonders of modern medicine that have improved our quality of life as well as our longevity: the anti-depressants and insulin pumps and quadruple bypasses. Americans enjoy longer, healthier lives in more stable families and communities than we did 20 years ago. But other than the crime trends, these facts are rarely reported or shared via word-of-mouth channels. Idea of American exceptionalism a powerful force through history . Many Americans, for instance, are convinced that \"half of all marriages end in divorce,\" though that hasn't been the case since the early 1980s, when divorce rates peaked at just over 50%. Since then, they have declined by almost a third. This is not merely a story of success in advanced industrial countries. The quality-of-life and civic health trends in the developing world are even more dramatic. Even though the world's population has doubled over the past 50 years, the percentage living in poverty has declined by 50% over that period. Infant mortality and life expectancy have improved by more than 40% in Latin America since the early 1990s. No country in history has improved its average standard of living faster than China has over the past two decades. Of course, not all the arrows point in a positive direction, particularly after the past few years. The number of Americans living in poverty has increased over the past decade, after a long period of decline. Wealth inequality has returned to levels last seen in the roaring '20s. Today, the U.S. unemployment rate is still just under 8%, higher than its average over the past two decades. Household debt soared over the past 20 years, though it has dipped slightly thanks to the credit crunch of the last few years. And while the story of water and air pollution over that period is a triumphant one, the long-term trends for global warming remain bleak. We are much more likely to hear about these negative trends than the positive ones for two primary reasons. First, we tend to assume that innovation and progress come from big technology breakthroughs, from new gadgets and communications technologies, most of them created by the private sector. But the positive trends in our social health are coming from a more complex network of forces: from government intervention, public service announcements, demographic changes, the shared wisdom of life experiences passed along through generations and the positive effects of rising affluence. The emphasis on private sector progress is no accident; it is the specific outcome of the way public opinion is shaped within the current media landscape. Opinion: How progress is possible in Obama's second term . The public sector doesn't have billions of dollars to spend on marketing campaigns to trumpet its successes. A multinational corporation invents a slightly better detergent, and it will spend a legitimate fortune to alert the world that the product is now \"new and improved.\" But no one takes out a prime-time ad campaign to tout the remarkable decrease in air pollution that we have seen over the past few decades, even thought that success story is far more important than a trivial improvement in laundry soap. That blind spot is compounded by the deeper lack of interest in stories of incremental progress. Curmudgeons, doomsayers, utopians and declinists all have an easier time getting our attention than opinion leaders who want to celebrate slow and steady improvement. The most striking example of this can be seen in the second half of the 1990s, a period in which both economic and social trends were decisively upbeat: The stock market was surging, but inequality was in fact on the decline; crime, drug use, welfare dependence, poverty -- all were trending in an encouraging direction. With a Democrat in the White House, you might assume that the op-ed pages of The Washington Post would be bursting with pride over the state of the nation, given the paper's center-left leanings. But you would be wrong. Over the course of 1997, in the middle of the greatest peacetime economic boom in U.S. history (and before the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke), 71% of all editorials published in the Post that expressed an opinion on some aspect of the country's current state focused on a negative trend. Less than 5% of the total number of editorials concentrated on a positive development. Even the boom years are a bummer. I suspect, in the long run, the media bias against incremental progress may be more damaging than any bias the media display toward the political left or right. The media are heavily biased toward extreme events, and they are slightly biased toward negative events -- though in their defense, that bias may just be a reflection of the human brain's propensity to focus more on negative information than positive, a trait extensively documented by neuroscience and psychology studies. The one positive social trend that did generate a significant amount of coverage -- the extraordinary drop in the U.S. crime rate since the mid-'90s -- seems to have been roundly ignored by the general public. The violent crime rate (crimes per thousand people) dropped from 51 to 15 between 1995 and 2010, truly one of the most inspiring stories of societal progress in our lifetime. And yet according to a series of Gallup polls conducted over the past 10 years, more than two-thirds of Americans believe that crime has been getting worse, year after year. Whether these biases come from media distortions or our human psychology, they result in two fundamental errors in the popular mind: We underestimate the amount of steady progress that continues around us, and we misunderstand where that progress comes from. We should celebrate these stories of progress, not so we can rest on our laurels but instead so we can inspire the next generation to build on that success.

She peered at herself in the rusted mirror and cautiously smiled. For a moment, her war-torn world was transformed and she was a beautiful bride -- free, safe and happy. Boom! A mortar shell exploded somewhere near her Syrian home in Homs, waking her from a daydream. She quickly wrapped a white headscarf tightly around her hair and prepared to leave for her wedding. Only a week earlier, Al-Qassab met her husband-to-be, Mohammad Jumbaz. Their families had coordinated the introduction. He was a pastry chef and part-time fighter for the rebel Free Syrian Army which wants to oust President Bashar al-Assad. She was 18 and from a family who didn't like the al-Assad government. They took no lingering looks across the room, and time didn't stand still when their eyes met. They simply chatted as Syria's nearly 20-month-old civil war rumbled in the background. \"I had a feeling in my heart,\" Jumbaz said, recalling that day. \"I cannot describe it to you.\" During the interview, a shell boomed in the distance. \"In a time when we are under siege and there are sounds like this, I told my mother I decided to fulfill half my religion and to get married,\" he said, \"and without ever even seeing my bride, everything went perfect.\" Al-Qassab agrees. \"We saw each other and we liked each other,\" she said, \"and in just one week we were married to each other.\" Marriage as revolution . Homs has borne the brunt of the Syrian military's wrath since violence broke out nearly two years ago in the nation. Many who live in the city consider it to be the unbowed guardian of the Syrian revolt. A massacre in the spring killed scores of women and children. There, even marriage is an act of revolution. \"We must get married. Our lives must continue,\" Jumbaz said defiantly. \"We have not surrendered, and we will not surrender. This is a promise. A promise we will keep, God willing.\" Out of respect for the dead, the couple held a small ceremony in the family apartment rather than a traditional large and noisy Syrian wedding. \"It was not appropriate to dance and play music,\" Jumbaz said. \"We recently received the body of my martyred brother, and many other families have martyrs as well. So it was a small family affair.\" Speaking via Skype, the couple seems to have little interest in chatting about romance or the frivolities of weddings. Instead, both are enthralled with their love for revolution and an ancient country that appears lost to war and strife. \"I wore a white dress, but we did not have a traditional wedding because of this animal in power,\" Al-Qassab said. \"We hope once the regime falls we can have a wedding, because our happiness is the end of this government.\" The couple spent their honeymoon at home, struggling to survive as al-Assad's forces relentlessly shelled Homs. But Al-Qassab said she is very happy to stay. \"Here, we have our pride and we are defending our nation,\" she said. \"I would prefer my honeymoon to be here amid the bombs and shells then for me to abandon my nation.\" In the Middle East, where arranged marriages are common, there is an Arabic word for love after marriage: \"ashra.\" It means the love from living life together. It is emotion based on mutual respect, understanding and a need for a partner to survive all life's struggles. \"I am not upset that I got married under these circumstances,\" Al-Qassab said. \"The opposite. I am proud that I married one of the revolutionaries, and I am proud to be here in old Homs defending my nation and my dignity.\" Now, after more than a year and a half of violence, living life amid the constant killing and dying is the greatest form of rebellion for the couple. \"I took this step, because I am a man who has faith in God and destiny,\" Jumbaz said. \"The days that passed were very hard on us. I still thank God for everything, but I felt something was missing in my life. I do not know how to describe it. \"Every day was a struggle, but something was missing.\" A baker becomes a fighter . Before the Syrian civil war turned Homs into a conflict zone, Jumbaz owned a baked-sweets business, selling cakes and candy to the mainly pro-government Allawi and Christian districts near his native neighborhood in Homs' Old District. \"When my brother was killed, I decided to return to my community and support my people, because what was happening was unjust,\" he said. \"Seventy percent of my friends have been killed in this and that massacre. This is an unbearable level of injustice.\" Al-Assad must be tried for war crimes, he believes. Jumbaz joined the rebel Free Syrian Army and fought alongside other members of the armed opposition to liberate an opposition enclave in Homs. While the Old District remains under siege and constantly sustains shelling and mortar fire, Syrian troops remain outside the neighborhood, stationed along the outskirts of the suburb. \"There are enough Free Syrian Army troops to protect us now, but I noticed how difficult the situation is around us,\" Jumbaz said. Now, Jumbaz spends his days kneading rations of flour and bits of butter into dough, creating sweet, creamy Syrian desserts. \"The kids wanted sweets and many of the women were craving desserts, so I am trying to bake sweets again,\" he said. Faithful and not afraid . Al-Qassab said she visits her parents and relatives every day to help with household duties, and she checks on the well-being of her neighbors until the evening, when her new husband returns home. \"I am not afraid of anything happening to him, and I thank God. We are all willing to sacrifice our lives for Syria,\" Al-Qassad said. \"I thank God above all else.\" Another single loud explosion thundered in the background as they spoke. The couple didn't even flinch. \"I pray no one is hurt\" Jumbaz calmly said. He turned to his wife, who wore a faded purple coat and tight black headscarf. \"Please, go ahead,\" he said, kindly signaling her to speak. \"We will not surrender, God willing,\" she said. \"We are walking along the righteous path. My cousins, my neighbors, the children of my neighbors all died, and many more have lost their lives. But I am not sad. We will be victorious in this life and the afterlife.\" Al-Qassab looks older than her 18 years, and she speaks with impenetrable courage and bravery that generally masks any semblance of a giggling blushing bride only a few weeks into her marriage. \"We were married September 13, 2011,\" she said before finally cracking a smile and beginning to laugh. \"I mean 2012.\" She turns to her husband, blushing and embarrassed. He looks down to hide that he is laughing, too, instead mumbling to correct her: \"2012.\" Nothing it seems but sheer faith in God moves the newlyweds and inspires them to love, and to fight and resist forces in Syria they feel must end. After nearly every sentence, they defiantly say \"Alhamdulillah,\" a common Muslim phrase meaning \"I thank God.\" \"My only hope is that this monster will be removed from power so we can live in peace and our children can live in peace,\" Al-Qassab starts. \"And if not our kids, then the children of our community even if we die,\" her husband adds. \"Alhamdulillah.\"</td><td>Many Syrians are determined to live their lives despite a war ravaging their nation .\n",

Battling heavy snow, rescue personnel and a California National Guard helicopter reached the three men around noon (3 p.m. ET) Thursday. The men were part of a group of 10 hikers who set out on their journey up the mountain on Monday. About 45 people looked for the three hikers -- Phillip Michael Abraham, 34; Dale Clymens, 45, and Stevan James Filips, 45 -- the National Park Service said in a statement. All three were able to walk and move during a general health assessment. Two other hikers on a 36-mile cross-country loop were supposed to return Tuesday. They are Sinh Baghsohi, 27, and his father, whose first name is unknown, park officials said. Both men are originally from Iran, but their current residences are not known. The younger Baghsohi is 6 feet, 5 inches tall and weighs about 287 pounds. His father is 6 feet tall and weighs 180 pounds. They had hiked in with a friend, who became ill and hiked out, the park service said. Dave Paladino, an Omaha, Nebraska, resident and leader of the larger group, said extreme weather dumped up to three feet of snow and drastically lowered visibility in Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks. The group of 10 hikers shared a love of climbing, outdoor activities and adventure, Paladino said. They set out on their hike shortly after 4 a.m. Monday in several sub-groups, including one led by Paladino and another including all three missing hikers. \"Every single one had been training for this event for years,\" said Paladino. The snow began for Paladino's group when they reached 10,000 feet up what he called the \"10-mile hill,\" and picked up significantly as they went up another 2,000 feet. His group reached the summit around 3:30 p.m. Monday, staying briefly at a shelter there before going back down the mountain. The climb back down was much more difficult than expected, according to Paladino, due to the heavy snow. \"It was by far the hardest thing we've ever done,\" said Paladino, who said he has climbed Mount Rainier in Washington state, among other peaks. At one point, his group met and talked briefly with the climbers who later went missing.  Abraham later sent several texts, the last of which was between 4 a.m. and 6 a.m. Tuesday in which they said they couldn't find the trail because of the snow and were heading to the summit shelter. The three climbers did not have snow shoes, said Paladino.  However, they likely had enough food and water to last several days, he said. Temperatures near the mountain's peak were in the 20s, Paladino added, not low enough to make frostbite a major concern. A rescue operation involving two hikers was begun and aborted Wednesday because of the snow. On Thursday morning, \"bigger and more experienced teams\" were brought in, said Paladino. \"We wanted to do this,\" said Paladino. \"These guys were doing what they loved, and we'll continue to do what we love.\"</td><td>Two hikers still missing are from a separate group on Mount Whitney .\n",

The statement could signal the Taliban's public willingness to talk to the United States for the first time. Calling himself \"Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan spokesman,\" Zabiullah Mujaheed said the Taliban have a \"preliminary agreement with Qatar and other respective sides.\" The Taliban are asking for the release of prisoners from the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in exchange for opening the office, he said. He said the group is also \"ready for talks and negotiation inside the country.\" It appears to be the first time the Taliban -- who ruled Afghanistan from 1996 until 2001, when they were ousted in a U.S.-led invasion -- have offered talks without the condition of an American withdrawal from the country. Read more about Qatar as a mediator . It is not clear if the purported spokesman speaks for all parts of the loose-knit Afghan Taliban. His statement was released in Pashto, a local language. \"The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has always tried to solve any problem with its opposite side through talks,\" the statement said. The U.S. Embassy in Kabul responded cautiously to the statement. \"We support an Afghan-led reconciliation process in which the Taliban breaks with al Qaeda, renounces violence and accepts the Afghan constitution, especially protections for minorities and women,\" said Gavin Sundwall, a U.S. Embassy spokesman. In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the United States is prepared to support an Afghan-led reconciliation. \"But this process will only be successful if the Taliban are prepared to renounce violence, break ties with al Qaeda, support the Afghan constitution in all of its elements, including human rights for all citizens, and particularly for women,\" she said. Nuland said U.S. officials are not aware of any formal announcement, \"but we are prepared to support a process that the Afghans support. \" A top Afghan peace official said he was \"cautiously optimistic\" about the Taliban statement. \"We are optimistic that they want to come to the negotiating table, but we have to be cautious because words alone are not enough,\" said Ismail Qassemyar, a member of the country's High Peace Council. He agreed with the Americans that talks had to take place between Afghans. The peace talks are \"an Afghan process .... Americans can't give them anything in Afghanistan because America can't make any decision on behalf of the Afghan nation,\" he said. Last week he warned against the United States or other nations trying to strike their own peace deals with the militants. \"We ask our international friends not to hold any kind of talks with the Taliban leaders,\" Qassemyar said December 27. Recent media reports have said the United States and other foreign governments with a stake in the Afghan war may try to strike a separate deal with the Taliban. The Washington Post reported in December that the Obama administration reached a tentative deal with Taliban negotiators that would have included the Taliban's public renunciation of international terrorism and the transfer of five Afghans from Guantanamo Bay. The deal collapsed, the Post said, because of Afghan President Hamid Karzai's objections. Any talk of a peace process slowed in September when suicide bombers killed senior Afghan peace negotiator and former President Burhannudin Rabbani. Karzai told CNN in December that the government cannot hold talks until the Islamic militia identifies a representative with the authority to negotiate. Karzai said Rabbani's death showed that \"we were actually talking to nobody.\" \"A man who came in the name of a messenger for peace turned out to be a suicide bomber,\" Karzai said. \"Therefore, we have now clearly said that we will welcome a Taliban address, but that address must have the clarity that this representative is authorized and is representing the Taliban movement as we see it.\" Qassemyar said a Taliban office in Qatar would by no means legitimize the Islamist group. \"We accept an address for the Taliban in Qatar if they come there as a movement or a group, not a government or use it as a propaganda venue,\" he said.</td><td>NEW: Nuland: \"We are prepared to support a process that the Afghans support\"\n",

Yet Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is fast becoming the favorite Middle East strongman of American conservatives and Republican presidential hopefuls. Jeb Bush says he can't understand why the White House has told Sisi \"you're not on our team\" as jihadism spreads like wildfire through the Middle East. Ted Cruz, another GOP 2016 pretender has also praised him, and key conservative media figures are lionizing Sisi. The rush of affection for the former Army Chief contrasts with the strained relationship between Sisi and the White House, reflected in the Obama administration's decision not to publicly back air strikes by Egypt on a common enemy -- ISIS -- in Libya this week. It's also the latest manifestation of the decades-long tussle between the U.S. and Egypt, which pits a push for human rights and democracy against the yearning for a stable pro-U.S. partner in a chaotic region, whatever the character of its regime. The spur for the conservative infatuation for Sisi was a speech in January in which the Egyptian leader warned Islam was being \"torn\" and \"destroyed\" by extremism. \"It's inconceivable that the thinking that we hold most sacred should cause the entire Islamic world to be a source of anxiety, danger, killing and destruction for the rest of the world,\" said Sisi. Sisi spoke in a highly symbolic venue, the Al Azhar Mosque in Cairo, one of the most vaulted seats of learning in the Muslim world. \"It's antagonizing the entire world! Does this mean that 1.6 billion people (Muslims) should want to kill the rest of the world's inhabitants -- that is 7 billion -- so that they themselves may live? Impossible!​\" On the face of it, Sisi's speech was a call to cleanse Islam of extremist thought and elements which groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda have used to justify jihad. It continues to impress conservatives in the United States amid a fierce political debate about how to contain ISIS's march across the region. \"He gave this incredible speech about Muslim extremism, and saying it's the responsibility of the Arab world to step up to fight this; that the first risks are for countries like Egypt,\" Bush said in Chicago on Wednesday. It's no coincidence that Republicans are praising the speech's blunt message at the same time as they are accusing President Barack Obama of falling prey to political correctness in his unwillingness to state the U.S. is at war with radical Islam. That comparison is also frequently being made on conservative talk radio. Cruz also praised Sisi on Fox News on Wednesday. \"What would be far better to see was the kind of courage that was demonstrated just a few weeks ago by President al-Sisi in Cairo,\" Cruz said. \"Why don't we see the president of the United States demonstrating that same courage, just to speak the truth, about the face of evil we are facing right now?\" Cruz asked. Mike Huckabee, another potential Republican presidential contender, said \"thank God for President al-Sisi in Egypt\" in an interview with NewsMax TV. Southern Baptist leader Richard Land wrote in The Christian Post that the Sisi speech could be as historically resonant as Martin Luther King's \"I have a Dream\" speech or president John Kennedy's declaration : \"Ich bin ein Berliner.\" Conservative commentator George Will said on Fox News Sunday last month that Sisi may deserve the Nobel Peace Prize. But are U.S. political figures ripping a speech redolent with Egyptian political overtones out of context to back up their own positions? Professor Nathan Brown of George Washington University said that Sisi's remarks were not that unusual and that a number of Arab leaders have previously given similar speeches to limited effect. \"It is standard stuff,\" he said. And Sisi's record toward political opponents and extremists, especially the Muslim Brotherhood, which formed Egypt's first democratic government until it was ousted by his army amid mass protests in 2013, paints a different picture of the Egyptian leader. \"The way that Sisi represents dealing with them is not through abstract theological arguments but through a severe security and political response,\" said Brown, who is also with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"That is what he represents. That part of the message gets lost.\" The State Department and rights groups fault Egypt for the removal of a civilian government, using lethal force to disburse MB protests, and for killing hundreds of protestors nationwide and say discrimination against Christians and Jews in Egypt remains widespread. Some analysts interpreted Sisi's speech as a way to justify the exclusion from politics of Islamist elements from political life in Egypt following his landslide win in an election last year in which the Brotherhood was banned. Since the election, the Obama administration has tried to carefully restore ties with Egypt on the grounds that it remains a vital strategic partner. Secretary of State John Kerry visited Cairo in September and Obama met Sisi on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York last year. Close intelligence cooperation continues behind the scenes. But relations have remained strained. After the coup the U.S. temporarily held up a tranch of $500 million in military aid to Egypt and an order of attack helicopters. Reconciliation has been made more difficult by the detention in Egypt of foreign journalists. The spectacle of Putin getting a warm welcome from Sisi in a visit last week did not go unnoticed in Washington, and was an apparent sign from the Cairo government that if the U.S. does not take better care of its friends, Egypt  will look elsewhere. The Pentagon, meanwhile, said it was not even told in advance about Egyptian air strikes this week on ISIS targets in Libya in revenge for the beheadings of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christian workers by an ISIS-affiliated group. \"It's a complex relationship that we have with Egypt,\" said Pentagon spokesman John Kirby. ISIS's swift spread in the Arab world has some realists in Washington considering whether it's time to re-emphasise the stability dimension of the U.S. relationship with Cairo. Bush suggested as much on Wednesday, in remarks that were especially noteworthy because the second term administration of his brother, George W. Bush, angered the government of then Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak by issuing a call for democracy in the Arab world as part of its Freedom Agenda. Jeb Bush asked Wednesday: \"Is (Sisi) a little \"L\" liberal democrat that believes in freedom like we do?\" \"No, he isn't. But I think we have to be practical,\" Bush said in the first foreign policy speech of his putative presidential campaign which could augur another turn in the roller coaster US-Egypt relationship. \"We have to balance our belief in liberty with a belief that security and engagement will create the possibilities for the Egyptians to garner more freedom. \"</td><td>Republicans praise tough Egyptian line on radical Islam .\n",

Martin's toxicology report indicates that THC, the active drug in marijuana, was in his blood at the time of his death on February 26, 2012. Zimmerman, a former neighborhood watch captain, is charged with second-degree murder for killing 17-year-old Martin in Sanford, Florida. He told police that night that the teenager looked suspicious and that there had been several break-ins in the neighborhood. The two got into a physical altercation, and Zimmerman said he was forced to draw his gun and kill Martin. Zimmerman's attorneys argued Monday that the report shows Martin's judgment may have been impaired the night of the shooting and that it may have affected his decision-making. Prosecutors fought hard against the admission of Martin's THC levels, accusing Zimmerman's attorneys of trying to get bad-character evidence in through the backdoor. Judge Debra Nelson told prosecutors they could cross-examine expert defense witness who testify about the effects of THC. Prosecutors can also call their own expert to contradict the defense's case during their rebuttal. Zimmerman's drug use has also come up in the case. Ben Crump, Martin's family's attorney, says Zimmerman should have been tested for drugs the night of the shooting. A fire and EMS report says Zimmerman was on the medications Librax and Temazepam at the time of the incident.

State news agency Xinhua said labels tagged to the pigs' ears indicated they came from the upper waters of the Huangpu River, which flows through the center of Shanghai and is a source of the city's drinking water. It's not clear why the pigs had been dumped in the river, though local media reported earlier this month that a disease had killed thousands of pigs in a village south of Shanghai. \"We will continue to trace the source, investigate the cause, co-operate with neighboring areas and take measures to stop the dumping of pigs into rivers,\" the Shanghai Municipal Agricultural Commission said in a statement posted on their website on Monday. As of Sunday, water quality on the Songjiang section of the river, where most of the pigs were found, remained normal and the incident has had \"no significant effect on tap water supply,\" the commission added. However, local residents and users of of the popular Twitter-like microblog service Sina Weibo have expressed concern that the dead pigs would make the city's tap water unsafe to drink. \"Huangpu river is the source of drinking water for more than 20 million Shanghai residents. And this horrific incident was only made public when residents started posting pictures on Weibo,\" business investor Xue Manzi said in a post on his account. The agricultural commission said it had tested organ samples from the pig carcasses and the results suggested the animals had contracted a type of porcine circovirus. According to Professor Fred Leung, who specialises in animal diseases at Hong Kong University, this is a fairly common disease in pigs and not usually fatal on its own. Pictures showed sanitation workers with sticks retrieving the bloated bodies of small pigs caught up in reeds and debris at the side of the river. A local newspaper in Jiaxing, a city in Zhejiang province south of Shanghai, reported on March 6 that tens of thousands of pigs had died of an animal disease in a major pig farming village in the past two months. \"According to our records, 10,078 pigs died in January, another 8,325 died in February. More than 300 pigs die everyday in our village, and we barely have any space left to dispose of the dead pigs,\" a local villager was quoted by the paper as saying. Chen Yi, a veterinarian at the Shanghai Academy of Agricultural Sciences, told the Global Times newspapers that farmers are required by law to dispose of dead animals at community disposal sites or bury them with disinfectant.

A JetBlue plane was held in North Carolina for two hours while passengers were interviewed. One passenger aboard JetBlue Flight 455 was taken into custody at Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina after the plane landed about 5:45 p.m. A federal Transportation Security Administration spokeswoman said one person was injured in the face by what may have been a punch. She said the fight involved three people who are thought to be related. According to the airline, there were 88 people and four crew members aboard the jet. The flight had been scheduled to leave Boston at 1 p.m. but did not take off until 3:11 p.m., spokeswoman Alison Eshelman said. Eyewitnesses said the scuffle was between two brothers, one of whom was angry that his brother had smoked on a plane.

The war council -- made up of top Cabinet, Pentagon and administration officials -- met with Obama for the eighth time to discuss a request by the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan for up to 40,000 more troops. The meeting lasted more than two hours, according to the senior administration official. \"The president and his team discussed the length of time that it would take to implement the options he's been presented,\" the senior official said. \"The president believes that we need to make clear to the Afghan government that our commitment is not open-ended. After years of substantial investments by the American people, governance in Afghanistan must improve in a reasonable period of time to ensure a successful transition to our Afghan partner.\" In particular, Obama pushed for revisions in proposed plans for troop increases to clarify how and when U.S. troops would turn over responsibility to the Afghan government, the official said. The president's questions at the meeting could change how many troops eventually are sent to Afghanistan, as well as how long they would be there, according to the senior administration official. Before the meeting, Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. military commander in the Middle East, said the meeting would continue evaluating how best to carry out the mission in Afghanistan. Petraeus provided no specifics on options under consideration, but said the process is approaching completion. \"I think we are indeed nearing a decision on this very important topic,\" he said, emphasizing the need to focus on the mission of ensuring that Afghanistan \"does not once again become a sanctuary or safe haven for al Qaeda and the kind of transnational extremists that carried out the 9/11 attacks.\" Earlier, a senior administration official and a U.S. military official independently told CNN that one option presented to Obama calls for sending about 34,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan in addition to the 68,000 already committed to the country. The military official said the plan would send three U.S. Army brigades, totaling about 15,000 troops; a Marine brigade of about 8,000 troops; a headquarters element of about 7,000 troops; and 4,000 to 5,000 support troops. The combat brigades would be brought in gradually, in three-month intervals, according to the military official. The troops would be spread across the country, mainly focusing in the south and southeast, where much of the fighting is, according to the official. The military official said the option has been a favorite at the Pentagon in recent weeks. That is only one option, the senior administration official emphasized. Three other options, the official said, would be \"different mixes,\" or \"different components of it.\" The senior administration official said Obama was expected to ask the war council meeting about cooperation the United States can expect from the government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai, civilian support the United States is willing to offer, and support the United States can expect from other countries. On Wednesday night, The Washington Post and The New York Times reported that concerns have been raised recently by the U.S. Ambassador in Kabul about Karzai's ability to rid his country's government of corruption and mismanagement. All those factors could lead to \"further refinements\" or some \"greater elements being considered,\" the official said, adding: \"He's got to fine-tune this, put it all together ... for what direction best advances our interests.\" Despite reports to the contrary, Obama has not decided the number of U.S. troops he will send to Afghanistan, White House officials said. Such reports are \"absolutely false,\" Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said. Anyone who suggests otherwise, \"doesn't have, in all honesty, the slightest idea what they're talking about.\" White House officials would not say whether Wednesday's meeting with the war council would be Obama's last with that group before deciding on Afghanistan. They said he would continue to discuss the war effort in smaller groups in coming days, including during his trip to Asia, which starts Thursday. Republican members of the Senate Armed Services Committee urged Obama in a letter sent Wednesday -- Veterans Day -- to agree to the request for additional troops by U.S. military leaders in Afghanistan. The letter, signed by 10 GOP committee members, said success in Afghanistan will require local leaders and citizens being able to govern and secure their own country without \"substantial\" international assistance. \"This won't be perfect or easy, but it will allow America's fighting men and women to leave Afghanistan with honor, and it will enable Afghans to build a better, more peaceful future,\" the letter said. \"That is our goal, and we must stay in the fight until is is won.\" Republican leaders have criticized Obama for taking so long to decide on the troop request, but Petraeus said the process of analyzing the situation has been \"very useful.\" \"There has been a refinement of objectives; there has been discussion of various courses of action,\" he said. \"There have been explanations and discussions about how the civilian component of this will complement what is done by the work of our military troops. All in all, I think it has been a very productive couple of months that we have spent on this.\" Also Wednesday, a new national poll showed Americans are split over whether Obama is taking too long to decide whether to send more U.S. troops to the war in Afghanistan. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey also indicated that, by a narrow margin, Americans think the president should listen to the recommendations of the generals in charge of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. According to the survey, 49 percent of people questioned say the president is taking too long to decide whether to increase U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan; 50 percent do not. \"There is a gender gap on this question, with most men saying Obama is taking too long and most women willing to give him more time,\" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. \"That's due in part to the partisan differences between men and women, but gender differences on the use of military force, and maybe even differences in how the genders make important decisions, can also be contributing to the split.\" The poll indicates that 52 percent think Obama should listen to the generals, with 48 percent saying the president should take other matters into account as well. But a troop buildup remains unpopular, with a separate question indicating that a majority opposes sending more troops. Roughly one in five Americans opposes more troops, yet also thinks that Obama should pay attention to the U.S. military leaders in that country, Holland said. \"That suggests that a lot of people who don't support a troop build-up are unaware of Gen. Stanley McChrystal's request for a bigger U.S. military presence there,\" he said. \"And that, in turn, indicates that the military leaders in the field might provide Obama some political cover if he decides to increase troop strength there.\" The poll also suggests widespread agreement among Americans that Afghanistan will never have a stable democratic government, with only one in 10 people questioned saying that will occur within a year, and one-third saying it will ever happen. Overall, 56 percent of Americans oppose sending more troops, while 42 percent favor increasing troop strength. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted October 30-November 1, with 1,018 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points for the overall sample.

Donna Fairchild and Bill Fairchild were found in a residence in the city of Mesquite, Nevada, on Interstate 15 near the border with Arizona, authorities said. Police got a call from the residence about 4:30 a.m. Each apparently suffered a single gunshot wound, the city said. Autopsies are scheduled for Wednesday. Results from the Clark County Coroner's Office were expected to take four to six weeks, according to a statement from the city. Mesquite city spokesman Bryan Dangerfield would not comment on the circumstances of their deaths but said police confirmed that a note and a 9 mm handgun were found at the scene. \"The content of the note will not be disclosed until the investigation is complete,\" Dangerfield said. City Manager Timothy Hacker said he believed that Donna Fairchild was concerned about the agenda items, according to CNN Las Vegas affiliate KLAS. The City Council was required to meet Tuesday night, but in light of the day's events, Dangerfield said the allegations against Fairchild probably would not be debated. Two prayers were offered by pastors during the meeting, he said. Fairchild, who was a candidate for mayor, told the Desert Valley Times last week that she would not comment on the allegations against her, but instead would talk about them Tuesday night. Mayor Susan Holecheck and City Attorney Cheryl Truman Hunt had planned to ask the City Council to consider sanctioning Fairchild through possible reprimand, removal from boards or expulsion for filing a $94.60 mileage reimbursement request with the city for a January 4 Nevada Development Authority board meeting she allegedly did not attend, according to an item on the council agenda. Fairchild allegedly violated the city's code of conduct and its personnel policy, and allegedly fraudulently presented a claim to a public officer, Hunt wrote in a January 18 memo. Holecheck, who is seeking re-election, and Hunt also wanted the City Council to consider removing Fairchild as the city's representative to the Nevada Development Authority board of directors. According to a filing on the agenda, comments Fairchild made about the development authority in a newspaper article \"were negative towards this agency, and deemed incompatible with the mission of the agency and good working relations with other NDA board members.\" A January 7 article of the Desert Valley Times includes interviews and comments from Mesquite mayoral candidates. In the article, Fairview said, \"We just got a bill from the Nevada Development Authority: It costs $7,500 to belong. There was one thing that came out of the NDA, and that was Do It Best. That was huge for the community, but I don't think we're getting the bang for our buck.\" In the article, Fairchild said that Mesquite should be doing most of its own marketing. NDA Executive Director Somer Hollingsworth wrote Holecheck that Fairchild -- who was the city's representative to the board since July 2009 -- should have brought her concerns to him, rather than airing them publicly, especially since she was a member of the NDA executive committee, according to an e-mail attached with the filing. According to the agenda item, Fairchild could have discussed her issues with the NDA if she had attended the January 4 board meeting. Messages seeking comment were left with Holecheck and Hunt on Tuesday. A statement from the mayor's office and City Council said, \"It is with a heavy heart that we make this announcement. Mesquite has lost two citizens that have devoted their life to public service. On behalf of myself and the City Council, this is a tremendous loss to our community and we express our deepest sympathies to the Fairchilds' family, loved ones and friends.\" Donna Fairchild served on the City Council from 2001 to 2007 and was re-elected in 2009. She moved to Mesquite with Bill Fairchild in 1999 after they both retired from the Denver Police Department, the city said. Donna Fairchild also has been an EMT/paramedic and news reporter for KIMN/KYGO radio in Denver. In Mesquite, Bill worked at a recreation center and was a member of the Virgin Valley Honor Guard and the Veterans of Foreign War. The Fairchilds were married for 21 years, the city said.

Gilani did not explain how he knew the United States had confirmed the death of the man described by counterterrorism officials as al Qaeda's \"military brain.\" A spokesman for Kashmiri's jihadist group, Harakat-ul-Jihad-Islami, previously said Kashmiri was killed, along with some aides, in a strike late Friday night. Kashmiri's death is the first major kill or capture since Osama Bin Laden, and the highest profile drone target since Beitullah Mehsud in 2009. It could also be seen as an embarrassment for Pakistanis, who have twice in just over one month, had a major al Qaeda figure killed on their territory without their participation. U.S. drones now operate entirely autonomously in Pakistan, a Pakistani intelligence source has told CNN. Whereas before the United States cooperated with Pakistan and used their intelligence, today, the Americans have an intelligence network that allows them to go after terrorists unilaterally. Kashmiri, a veteran jihadist, was considered one of the most dangerous men in the world by counterterrorism officials on three continents. He was commander of \"Brigade 313\" of Harakat-ul-Jihad-Islami, which has formed a close relationship with al Qaeda. Kashmiri was also said to have ties with David Coleman Headley, the U.S. citizen who confessed to helping scout targets for the Mumbai attack in November 2008.</td><td>Kashmiri was seen at the location of the strike .\n",

They claim the defendants have a pattern of treating non-African American officers harsher than African American officers, when it comes to officer-involved shootings of African Americans. The plaintiffs in the federal suit are not African American. The incident cited in the suit began when officers saw a car speeding and heard what they thought was a gunshot directed towards them. It involved a nearly 25-minute chase and ended in a hail of 137 bullets, killing two people. Both were African American. No weapon was ever found in the car. In the wake of the shooting, the plaintiffs say they were placed on administrative leave for three days before reporting \"to the gym\" for a 45-day cooling off period. Months later, most of them were permitted to return to full duty, but they were then ordered back on restrictive duty, in a move the lawsuit claims was \"politically expedient.\" They remained on restrictive duty until June 2014 and so missed out on potential wages and chances to apply for promotions and transfers, according to the lawsuit. The nine plaintiffs allege their treatment was because of their race. \"The City of Cleveland, through the other named defendants, and the other named defendants in their individual capacities, have a history of treating non-African American officers involved in the shootings of African Americans substantially harsher than African American officers,\" reads the lawsuit, filed Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. It continues: \"A serious dichotomy exists as a result of the defendants' longstanding practices and procedures which place onerous burdens on non-African American officers, including the plaintiffs, because of their race and the race of persons who are the subjects of the legitimate use of deadly force.\" The plaintiffs are seeking an unspecified amount of damages. After-hours attempts Sunday to reach representatives of the city and police department were unsuccessful. The lawsuit comes on the heels of another high-profile police shooting in Cleveland. A 12-year-old boy died a week ago Sunday after being shot outside a recreation center. He had what police have said was an air gun that looked like a real firearm. Authorities are investigating that shooting, and the two officers involved are on leave from their jobs. In March 2013, the U.S. Justice Department announced an investigation into the use of force by Cleveland police, citing several incidents. That investigation is also ongoing.

T.I., left, performed to a packed crowd Sunday, days before he was to start a prison term. The rapper -- whose real name is Clifford Harris Jr. -- was required to be at the prison before noon local time to begin serving his sentence on federal weapons charges. According to news reports, officers from Forrest City and the prison set up a roadblock along Arkansas Highway 1 about one-tenth of a mile from the complex. Reporters were not allowed any closer to the prison. T.I. threw himself a going-away party Sunday night at Philips Arena in Atlanta, Georgia, before a packed house. During Sunday's concert -- called \"T.I.'s Final Goodbye Bash\" -- the 28-year-old Grammy winner reiterated a message that's become familiar in recent weeks: He wants others to learn from his mistakes. \"I'm doing the best I can to get out there, man, and put something positive on these young kids, man,\" T.I. said during the show. \"I try my best. I need y'all help, though.\" The rapper played to a sell-out crowd of 16,000 people, said Kenan Woods, a spokesman for the arena. T.I. played through much of his catalog, including the hits \"Whatever You Like,\" \"Live Your Life\" and the Grammy-winning \"Swagga Like Us,\" Woods said. At times in the show, Harris was joined on stage by fellow rapper Soulja Boy and by his five children and mother, Woods said. T.I. was sentenced in March on weapons charges related to purchasing machine guns and silencers. In addition to serving prison time, T.I. was placed on house arrest, was given community service and was ordered to pay a $100,300 fine. Though he had been in legal trouble before, Harris' current situation began when he was arrested just hours before he was to perform at the BET Hip-Hop Awards in Atlanta. The rapper had provided a bodyguard with $12,000 to buy weapons. Harris was not permitted to own any guns, however, because he was convicted in 1998 on felony drug charges -- possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute -- in Cobb County, in suburban Atlanta. After his arrest, he entered a plea agreement, which federal authorities called unique because it allowed the rapper to remain out of prison for a year while he performed community service. Harris has already left a strong mark on the hip-hop genre, music experts told CNN, which should position his career well when he is released. Harris had been named to the Forbes list of top-earning rappers, making an estimated $16 million in 2006. Some music industry observers have said T.I.'s prison term will only make him more popular. \"I think that if anything, it will gain him more fans and actually support his fan base, because he's talked about making a mistake,\" Emil Wilbekin, editor in chief of Giant Magazine, told CNN. \"He's talked about taking care of the error of his ways.\" The Atlanta rapper has expressed remorse for the situation. \"I would like to say thank you to some and apologize to others,\" he said at his sentencing in March. \"In my life, I have been placed in the worst-case scenario and had to make the best of it.\" In a March interview with CNN's T.J. Holmes, Harris said he no longer felt like he needed to carry weapons to protect himself. He said people should not idolize him for what he's gone through, but should take note of the fact that he has taken responsibility for his actions. \"You shouldn't take the things that I've gone through, and the negative parts of my life, and admire me for that. If anything, admire me for how I've accepted responsibility for the part I played in placing myself in these situations, and what I've done to recover from it,\" Harris said.

Earlier this week, the rivalry was evident when dozens of fighters clashed at a Tripoli hospital in what residents said was the biggest armed confrontation in the capital in weeks. Clashes erupted at 2 a.m. Monday when a half dozen former rebels from Zintan city in the western mountains stormed the hospital, according to doctors. Some of the former rebels were drunk, and demanded staff hand over a wounded fighter shot earlier that day, according to the doctors, who spoke on condition of anonymity for safety reasons. The patient and the body of a dead fighter had been taken to the hospital earlier, the doctors said, and the former rebels wanted to kill the wounded man. Hospital staff declined to hand over the patient, who was undergoing surgery. Tripoli fighters in charge of hospital security forced them out , but not before the returning fighters shot rounds in the hospital. Both groups called for backup, which arrived as fighting raged around the hospital grounds until 5 a.m. Witnesses said both sides were using heavy machine guns and anti-aircraft guns. Walls near a hospital entrance were riddled with bullets holes, and nearby glass doors and windows were shattered. Across the street, bullets pierced through the walls of two buildings. There were no deaths from gunshots, but medical staff said three patients died of stress-related causes that they linked to the fighting. At least three of the Tripoli fighters were wounded in the clashes, according to Salem Abaza, who is in charge of hospital security. He described it as the most serious incident of infighting so far. Accounts differed over how the three-hour battle concluded, but at least three witnesses said it ended after calls from a local imam and senior commanders from both groups talked by phone with their men. Tripoli fighters said Tuesday they are concerned about the rising tensions among the various groups, which are increasingly divided along regional allegiances. \"We are concerned, as you can see, every day there is fighting between the rebels, this is something we don't want, we want a united Libya,\" said fighter Tammam Basheer. The scene on Tripoli's streets these days -- heavily armed men brandishing guns and racing across the city with no central command and little or no accountability -- has raised concerns among residents. \"There are no security forces, everyone is running their own group, their own brigade, and they all control Tripoli,\" said Tripoli militia member Taha, who did not provide a second name. Disarming tens of thousands of fighters who brought down ruler Moammar Gadhafi and bringing them under control is a top challenge for the fledgling interim government. Acting Prime Minister Abdurrahim El-Keib is expected to present his Cabinet within two weeks. Military officials downplayed the tensions among the various militias, and say their biggest challenge is rebuilding the military. \"We would like to reorganize our army again,\" said Col. Ahmed Bani, the National Transitional Council's military spokesman. \"When we have a great and strong army, we are safe. We will save our dreams, we will save our democracy, our borders.\" At the Tripoli hospital, staff spoke of other recent incidents of intimidation by armed militiamen and called on authorities to provide protection and pull the weapons off the streets. \"We are really afraid, we do not want stethoscopes to be fighting guns,\" Dr. Ali Osman said.</td><td>Dozens of fighters clash at a Tripoli hospital this week .\n",

President Barack Obama chided Republicans for holding up a deal with unreasonable demands, and he urged college students to continue raising their voices on the issue. However, spokesmen for Republican leaders in the House and Senate denied an assertion by press secretary Jay Carney that the White House has been working with them to try to reach a deal. Asked about GOP complaints that the White House has not reached out to Republicans on the issue in recent days, Carney said that \"we are actively working with members of Congress to get this done,\" adding, \"in both parties.\" Spokesmen for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, disputed Carney's account. On the Senate floor, McConnell accused Obama and Democrats of playing political games on the issue. \"It is the Democrat-led Senate that has failed to act and the president who has failed to contribute to a solution, and the reason is obvious,\" McConnell said. \"It was reported yesterday that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is launching a website with a student loan countdown clock aimed at raising money off this issue. The implication is that Republicans are the ones dragging their feet. \" The only reason the issue remains unresolved \"is that the president wants to keep it alive,\" McConnell said, adding that \"he thinks it benefits him politically for college students to believe we're the problem.\" Despite such political back-and-forth, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said that \"a series of meetings over the last 48 hours\" with Republicans had raised hopes for a deal. \"At this stage, it appears that they are compromising, just as we are, and hope we can get something done,\" Reid said. Leaders of both parties insist that they want to keep the federally backed rate at 3.4% for another year, but they sharply disagree over how to pay the $6 billion cost. Democrats want to eliminate certain tax benefits for small-business owners, while Republicans want to cut a preventive-care fund created in 2010 as part of Obama's health care reform law. The Republican-majority House has passed its version of the measure, which Obama has threatened to veto. The Senate continues to negotiate an alternative version. If Congress fails to act by July 1, the rate jumps to 6.8%, with an average cost to students of $1,000 in increased loan debt, according to the White House. In his remarks at the White House to students campaigning for an extension of the current rate, Obama blamed Republicans for preventing a deal. \"Last month, Democrats in the Senate put forward a plan that would have kept these rates in place without adding a dime to the deficit. Unfortunately, Senate Republicans got together and blocked it,\" Obama said. \"Over in the House, the Republicans said they'd keep these rates down only if we agreed to cut things like preventative health care for women, which obviously wouldn't fix the problem but would create a new problem,\" the president continued. He also poked fun at an unidentified congressman, presumably Republican, who Obama said had warned that the student loan rate issue was about giving students \"free college education.\" That complaint \"doesn't make much sense, because the definition of a loan is, it's not free; you have to pay it back,\" Obama said. While Obama has repeatedly raised the issue in campaign appearances, certain GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney has also said Congress should act to keep the rate at 3.4%. In 2007, lawmakers temporarily cut the rate for undergraduates taking out federal Stafford loans up to the 2011 school year. The lower rates were phased in, so students have been able to access the lowest 3.4% rate on subsidized federal loans for only one school year. The 2007 law allows interest rates to revert back to 6.8% for the 2012-13 school year, which starts in July.

Pregnant aerobics instructor Mary Primis was teaching class when the gunman opened fire, critically injuring her. George Sodini, 48, brought four handguns into the LA Fitness gym outside Pittsburgh and used three of them, firing at least 36 times around 8 p.m. Tuesday, Allegheny County Police Superintendent Charles Moffatt said. Sodini, a member of the gym, was found dead in the aerobics room, lying on top of one of his guns about seven feet from one of the victims. Authorities believe Sodini targeted the aerobics class, because a schedule was found in his home with that class circled, Moffatt said. But police do not believe he targeted anyone personally. An online diary, as well as notes at the scene and at his home, have led them to believe he was targeting women in general. Read an edited version of the diary (PDF) In the note found at the scene in Sodini's gym bag, he complains he had never spent a weekend with a woman, never vacationed with a woman and never lived with a woman, and that he had had limited sexual experiences, Moffatt said. He makes similar complaints in his online blog, which also documents his growing rage at women for rejecting him and at the world he felt had abandoned him. Witnesses told police the gunman was dressed in black when he entered the class, shut off the lights, walked about 10 feet and opened fire. Mary Primis, 26, an aerobics instructor who is 10 weeks pregnant, was shot twice. \"I remember thinking I wanted to hold my breath because I was afraid, if he saw that I was breathing, he would shoot again,\" she told CNN affiliate WPXI from her hospital bed. Asked if she thought she was going to die, she said, \"I wasn't sure.\" Her husband, Alex Primis, said she was shot once in the left shoulder and again through the back of her shoulder blade. This was to be her last week teaching before taking time off for her pregnancy, Primis said. Sodini apparently had \"practice runs\" before the shooting Tuesday, Moffatt said. Someone at the gym had showed him how to shut off the lights, he said, not knowing his plans. \"He just had a lot of hatred in him, and he was hell bent on committing this act,\" Moffatt said.  Watch Moffatt describe contents of diary » . Sodini worked as a systems analyst in the finance department of K&L Gates, a law firm with an office in Pittsburgh, since 1999, Mike Rick, a spokesman for the firm, said. Neighbors described him as reclusive and said he had stopped talking to them in the past few years. On Tuesday, Sodini visited the gym three times -- the first about 11 a.m., a second time at 7:40 p.m. and a third time at 7:56 p.m., Moffatt said. Members of the gym are required to swipe a card to check in, but do not have to check out, he said. The first 911 call was dispatched at 8:16 p.m. Three of the four guns found with Sodini were traced back to him, and authorities are in the process of tracing the fourth, Moffatt said. They were two 9 mm semi-automatics, a .45-caliber revolver and a .38 in his pocket. Sodini also had 30-round ammunition clips that were illegal before the assault weapons ban was lifted in 2004, police said. Police know Sodini made a telephone call at 7:45 p.m., and believe he may have left the gym to make it. Authorities are attempting to locate the person he contacted, Moffatt said. Sodini did not mention killing himself in the note found at the scene, which was mostly typed with handwritten notations, but did mention it in a handwritten note found at his home, Moffatt said. Police seized Sodini's car for processing, but no guns were found in it, he said. They also seized his computer and were examining it. The shooting victims were taken to the three major hospitals in the area. Moffatt said he believed none of those who remained hospitalized Wednesday had life-threatening injuries. County officials said counselors were being made available to area residents in the wake of the shooting. Police spoke to a pastor mentioned on Sodini's online diary. The man said Sodini attended his church but stopped in 2006, and that there was a minor incident involving a woman who felt \"he was paying too much attention to her,\" Moffatt said. The pastor spoke to Sodini, and it stopped, he said. Moffatt said police have no knowledge of any mental health issues involving Sodini, but are still puzzled at the violence. \"I can't ever make sense of murders,\" he said.

When anyone would ask her what she wanted to be when she grew up, she would say she wanted to join the Army. Stockwell's parents thought she was going through a phase, but she joined the ROTC program while at the University of Colorado in Boulder. After graduating with a communications degree in 2002, she was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army's Transportation Corps. At 23 years old, Stockwell was deployed to Iraq in March 2004. Less than a month later, her life changed forever. She was part of a routine convoy going through central Baghdad when a big explosion went off. \"Think of the loudest noise you can imagine and our vehicle starts to swerve,\" she recalls. \"The woman in the front yells IED, IED, we've hit an IED!\" Stockwell's left leg was gone. \"It sounds strange, but as soon as I was told I didn't have my leg, I knew it was going to be OK,\" the veteran says. \"I just kind of had this almost peaceful feeling that, alright, it's going to be alright. Life isn't over.\" While recovering at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, Stockwell says she was inspired by other patients. \"You see these other soldiers and these other veterans that are missing two limbs, three limbs, sometimes four limbs ... and I looked at myself and I just really thought I'm one of the lucky ones and I kind of made a decision then that I was going to live my life for those who couldn't.\" Stockwell learned to walk with her new leg and become independent, but she knew she wouldn't feel like herself until she got back into sports. Opinion: Every day should be Veterans Day . \"Luckily there are organizations out there that really grab the wounded veterans from their hospital rooms and get them out doing things that they may not have ever done with two legs,\" she says. Four months after her injury, she went skiing in Colorado. The experience gave her an incredible feeling of freedom and opened up a world of new possibilities. After spending a year at Walter Reed, the Purple Heart and Bronze Star recipient medically retired from the Army. Stockwell went back to school for a new career in prosthetics at Century College in Minnesota. \"Basically you fit amputees with artificial limbs,\" she says. \"I didn't know the field existed until I needed a leg, but then I thought, 'Well that's pretty cool.' \" After moving to Minnesota, she joined her first competitive swim team. A presentation about the Paralympics inspired her to fight for her country on a new battlefield. \"I dreamed of going to the Olympics when I was younger,\" she says. \"And now it was almost like I had a second chance. So I decided to try in the sport of swimming. It was easy for me to swim. I didn't have to wear a prosthetic leg.\" In 2008, Stockwell became the first Iraq war veteran to be chosen for the U.S. Paralympic Team. She felt like her life had come full circle: \"It made me feel so, so alive.\" Today the 32-year-old veteran works as a certified prosthetist at Scheck and Siress in Chicago and runs a triathlon club she started with friends Keri Schindler and Dan Tun two years ago. Dare2Tri provides adaptive equipment and coaches for athletes with disabilities. Cancer survivor and amputee Hailey Danisewicz says Dare2Tri has taught her that, \"my possibilities as a person are endless and that I can do anything that I put my mind to.\" In October Danisewicz placed second at the Paratriathlon World Championships in New Zealand.

Shawn Custis, 42, allegedly forced his way into a Millburn, New Jersey, home around 10 a.m. on June 21 and brutally beat the woman while her young daughter sat motionless on a nearby couch. The woman's 18-month old son was sleeping upstairs. Custis fled the house with an undetermined amount of jewelry, Millburn police said. The entire episode was caught on the family's home security camera. Custis was also indicted on counts of endangering the welfare of a child, criminal restraint, and theft, according to Semper. Custis is currently being held at the Essex County Correctional Facility on $750,000 bail, prosecutors said. In the home video obtained by CNN affiliate WABC, Custis repeatedly punches the woman in the face while her daughter watches nearby. He throws her to the floor, chokes her, kicks her multiple times, and throws her down a flight of stairs. He does not hurt the daughter. After he leaves, the woman goes upstairs to retrieve her toddler son and waits with her two children for police to arrive. On the video, the child who witnessed the attack appears to be as young as 5 years old and likely no more than 8. The woman who was beaten told CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey that she made a conscious decision to try to remain silent in an attempt to protect her daughter. \"I knew that if I started screaming, my daughter would too, and I was afraid that she would get hurt,\" she said at the time. \"I took it. I didn't cry the entire time.\" The woman was later taken to an area hospital, where she was treated for a concussion, chipped teeth, and injuries to her face and legs, according to prosecutors. Custis was arrested in New York City by the FBI Fugitive Task Force and detectives from the Essex County Prosecutor's Office. Custis is to be arraigned on February 28, said the prosecutor's office. Custis' attorney, Olubukola \"Bukie\" Adetula, told CNN that he anticipates Custis will plead not guilty. \"We will do what we have to do to defend this case aggressively,\" Adetula said.

Simple reasoning, of course, but it's also an unnecessary consequence of combining legislation that makes guns readily available with \"stand your ground\" laws. I can already hear the clicking of keyboards from my desk, as the drinkers of NRA-flavored Kool-Aid feverishly type their outrage and disgust with any suggestion that gun laws need to be reviewed. I own guns. They are kept in my home. I strongly believe in the \"castle doctrine,\" which essentially means that homeowners have no duty or requirement to retreat in their home if they are attacked within it. If someone breaks into a stranger's home, the homeowner doesn't know whether the intruder is there to rob, rape, terrorize or have milk and cookies with them. Regardless, it's reasonable that a robber should have an expectation of death if he or she breaks into someone's home. Unstable ground: The fine line between self-defense and murder . Florida's stand your ground law was passed in 2005, under Gov. Jeb Bush's administration. This is the law that has garnered so much national attention since the Trayvon Martin shooting and George Zimmerman's arrest. Stand your ground legislation basically extends the castle doctrine to all places beyond the home. Retreat in order to avoid a confrontation becomes unnecessary even in a public place. Florida Statute 776.013 (3) states: . \"A person who is not engaged in unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.\" This law applies a confusing blend of subjective and objective standards. Stand your ground is appropriate in many circumstances, but the lack of clarity in the statute needs to be addressed and re-evaluated, particularly when firearms are so readily accessible in public places. The way the statute is written, an individual who observes a fistfight could conceivably shoot and kill the dominator in the fight if they reasonably believed that person was going to cause \"great bodily harm\" to the other. Even if the two combatants knew that the fight was nothing more than a \"good ol' boy\" disagreement, the way the statute is written could allow a gun to be used if the observer reasonably and actually believed that great bodily harm could occur. Moreover, merging the statute with overly relaxed gun laws could open the door for the guilty to walk away without consequence. Consider another gun-toting observer of the hypothetical fist fight, who is an enemy of one of the combatants. He could easily hide behind the claim that he reasonably believed that the other combatant was going to cause great bodily harm if the fight continued. The shooter could have every evil motive in the world, but so long as he stood behind the story that he reasonably believed the other person could suffer great bodily harm or death, then he could conceivably  walk. When guns are permitted in every public place and are mixed with such an obtusely written statute, a puzzling and perplexing standard of behavior regarding the use of guns occurs. This becomes a recipe for disaster and death. Gun laws and the stand your ground law need to be re-evaluated and addressed responsibly very soon.  If we don't learn lessons from the Trayvon Martin tragedy, then we are doomed to see similar events happen.

In the speech, Obama will explain why the United States is in Afghanistan, its interests there and his decision-making process, Gibbs said, but \"the president does not see this as an open-ended engagement. \"Our time there will be limited, and I think that's important for people to understand,\" he said. \"We are in year nine\" in Afghanistan, Gibbs told reporters. \"We're not going to be there another eight or nine years.\" Obama will meet with members of Congress at the White House on Tuesday afternoon before the speech. Cost issues are among the topics the president will address, Gibbs said. \"It's a million dollars a troop for a year,\" he said. \"Ten thousand troops is $10 billion. That's in addition to what we already spend in Afghanistan and Pakistan. That also does not include training, and it doesn't include the maintaining of a security force. It's very, very, very expensive.\" But, Gibbs added, \"I think the president, throughout this process, has talked about the cost in terms of American lives and in terms of the cost to our treasury, and I think he'll continue to talk about it.\" The president ordered more than 20,000 additional troops to Afghanistan in March. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, reportedly has called for up to 40,000 more to wage a counterinsurgency campaign against the Taliban, the Islamic militia originally ousted by U.S. military action in 2001. Obama has weighed several options for bolstering the American contingent, ranging from sending a few thousand troops to the 40,000 McChrystal requested. A defense official told CNN earlier this week the Pentagon is making detailed plans to send about 34,000 more troops to Afghanistan in anticipation of Obama's decision on the 8-year-old war. There had been no final word on Obama's decision as of Tuesday, said the Defense Department official, who has direct knowledge of the process. But the official said planners have been tasked with preparing to send 34,000 additional American troops to Afghanistan with the expectation that Obama was leaning toward approving that many. iReporters sound off; share your views on sending more troops in Afghanistan . Defense Secretary Robert Gates is expected to receive the paperwork Thursday to approve orders to deploy 1,000 Marines from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, to Afghanistan in late December -- the first of the new troops to be sent, a U.S. military official told CNN on Wednesday. The official is not authorized to talk about the plans because they have not been officially announced. The 1,000 Marines are part of a battalion task force that has been preparing and training for the deployment, the official said. The president held a lengthy meeting with top advisers Monday night, and he told reporters Tuesday that he would announce new plans for Afghanistan after Thanksgiving. McChrystal took part in the meeting Monday, along with Vice President Joe Biden, Gates, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen and Karl Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador in Kabul, Afghanistan. Obama said Tuesday that the deliberations had been \"comprehensive and extremely useful.\" \"It's going to be important to recognize that in order for us to succeed there [in Afghanistan], you've got to have a comprehensive strategy that includes civilian and diplomatic efforts,\" he said at a news conference Tuesday with visiting Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The defense official said Tuesday that the military is planning to send three U.S. Army brigades, totaling about 15,000 troops; a Marine brigade with about 8,000 troops; a headquarters element of about 7,000; and between 4,000 and 5,000 support troops -- a total of about 34,000 troops. CNN reported last month that this was the Pentagon's preferred option. However, the official said Wednesday that the Marines are expected to deploy 8,000 combat, aviation and support troops, plus 1,000 to 1,500 Marines as part of a headquarters unit -- a total of between 9,000 and 9,500. They will be in addition to the 11,000 Marines already in Afghanistan. After the first deployment, the remaining Marines will deploy over the next three to four months, the military official said. The troops would be dispatched throughout Afghanistan but would be focused mainly on the southern and southeastern provinces, where much of the recent fighting has taken place. Currently, brigades from Fort Drum in upstate New York and Fort Campbell in Kentucky are among those next in line to deploy. About 68,000 U.S. troops are in Afghanistan, along with about 45,000 from the NATO alliance. Two U.S. military officials have told CNN that NATO countries would be asked to contribute more troops to fill the gap between the 34,000 the Pentagon expects Obama to send and the 40,000 McChrystal wants. The request is expected to come during a December 7 meeting at the alliance's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will travel to Brussels next week to meet with allies, State Department sources told CNN. Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell would not discuss specific numbers, but he said NATO would be asked for additional help. Obama's Afghanistan plan will include \"very broad terms\" that show how and where the United States is succeeding in the nation, a senior U.S. military official told CNN. Those points will be used to determine how and when troops can be brought home. Another senior military official said McChrystal will take his orders from Obama and will do the best he can with what he has. The question, he said, is not the number of troops, but is whether the United States has \"the right resources to do what we need to do.\" \"We can't just go and blow people up and win this war,\" the official said. \"We have to gain the trust of the people, and that is a major part of the plan here.\" U.S.-led troops invaded Afghanistan in response to the al Qaeda terrorist network's September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. The invasion overthrew the ruling Taliban, which had allowed al Qaeda to operate from its territory -- but most of the top al Qaeda and Taliban leadership escaped the onslaught. Taliban fighters have since regrouped to the mountainous region along Afghanistan's border with Pakistan, battling U.S. and Afghan government forces on one side and Pakistani troops on the other. Al Qaeda's top leaders, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, remain at large and are suspected to be hiding in the same region. The conflict has so far claimed the lives of more than 900 Americans and nearly 600 allied troops.

Environment Minister Tony Burke is threatening to take Japan to international court, claiming a Japanese whaling fleet attacked Australian ships on Wednesday. But in the Japanese version of what happened, it's the Australians who deserve court sanctions. \"Japan needs to stop this once and for all,\" Burke told Australia's Seven Network on Thursday. \"What we are watching and what we've been seeing Japan do in that Southern Ocean year on year now is just disgusting. No other way of describing it. Now, as a government we don't settle it in the car park, we settle in the court,\" he said. \"There's been the most outrageous attack on the Sea Shepherd Australia ships,\" said Bob Brown, a member of the board of directors of Sea Shepherd Australia, describing it as the \"worst incident\" the anti-whaling group had experienced since one of its vessels sank two years ago. In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), Brown said that a large Japanese factory ship, the Nisshin Maru, had repeatedly rammed Sea Shepherd ships in the Southern Ocean near Antarctica where it was trying to refuel and that a Japanese government escort vessel had directed water cannon and lobbed concussion grenades at the activists. He claimed the Japanese ships had intruded into Australian territorial waters and breached international and Australian law. \"I'm very concerned and alarmed that Japan has decided to become pirates in our territorial waters,\" he said. \"It's time the Australian government acted.\" Burke told Seven Network it's not that simple. \"In terms of sending in the Navy, you've got to make sure you don't have a response here that blows up a whole lot of other things. The reason -- even though they're our territorial waters -- we don't assert that. And that's part of the whole Antarctic Treaty System, which prevents mining in Antarctica. You don't want to blow up that system,\" he explained. \"I've got to say with that court case we are now getting very close. It has been too long. We are now getting very close on that. But I'm not going to take an action that blows up the Antarctic Treaty System either,\" Burke said. \"What we will do, though, is take the action that we've taken already with the International Court of Justice to [expose] that this gimmick that they've got -- claiming that's its scientific whaling, when everybody knows that's a con.\" Japan annually hunts whales despite a worldwide moratorium, utilizing a loophole in the law that allows for killing the mammals for scientific research. Whale meat is commonly available for consumption in Japan. Each year, environmental groups such as Sea Shepherd face off with Japan's hunters in a high seas drama that has led to collisions of ships, the detaining of activists and smoke bombs fired back and forth between the groups. The Japan Fisheries Agency's Institute of Cetacean Research disputed the Australian claims in a statement. The ICR says three Sea Shepherd ships sailed recklessly and abnormally close to the Nisshin Maru and its fueling ship during a refueling operation on Wednesday. Although the Nisshin Maru tried to ward off the Australian ships with loud speakers and water cannons, the Sea Shepherd ships' \"extreme dangerous\" acts halted the refueling operation, the ICR said. During the process, the three Australian ships bumped the Nisshin Maru at least four times, causing some damage, the ICR said. The Japanese agency said it's considering filing a third claim in a U.S. court for Sea Shepherd's \"insults against the court authority.\" According to ICR, Sea Shepherd has been banned from threatening whaling ships' operations or sailing within 500 yards of whaling ships.

Han Lei, 39, was charged with intentional homicide over the death of the two-year-old girl who died in hospital from brain damage 50 hours after being dashed to the pavement in the Daxing District of Beijing on July 23. The court sentenced his friend Li Ming, who helped Han escape after the incident, to five years' jail. The Beijing No.1 Intermediate People's Court heard how Han and Li decided to drive to a karaoke bar after a dinner with several other people. Unable to find a parking space, they attempted to park at a bus stop where a woman, also surnamed Li, was waiting with the 2-year, 10-month-old baby who was named as Sun in court documents. An altercation began when Han accused the mother of blocking the car's path with the pushchair. The court heard how Han hit the mother and then proceeded to hurl the baby out of its pram. The court rejected his defense that he had been intoxicated at the time of the attack, saying that his mental condition had been \"stable\" despite earlier drinking at dinner. Prosecutors recommended that Han, who committed the crime within a year of being released from prison, be given the death sentence. \"I smacked her in the face. She hit back, too. People started to gather around us. I just wanted to smash the trolley,\" Han reportedly said in a statement to police. The girl's mother told police that Han had earlier threatened to kill the child and had acted before she was able to take measures to protect her. Han fled the scene with Li Ming, who was charged with harboring a criminal, but was arrested by police the next day. Li turned himself in to police on July 25. Relatives of the child asked for a total of 2.73 million yuan ($443,513) in civil compensation during the court hearing, according to state-run Xinhua. The case drew a strong response on Chinese social media site Weibo where posters mostly applauded the death sentence: \"He deserves to be shot 100 times,\" said poster Xiongwoxi while another, named as Wujiayounvchuzhangcheng, said the death sentence was not strong enough. \"Dying once is leniency,\" he said. Despite this, there were some calls to end capital punishment in China. \"Although he deserves the death, shouldn't we give him another chance? Do we must have people die one after another?\" said poster Linxidaxuesonglianli.</td><td>Beijing man sentenced to death after hurling a baby from its pram .\n",

Brown was 11 in February 2009 when, authorities say, he shot Kenzie Marie Houk, 26, once at point-blank range in her western Pennsylvania farmhouse. She was eight months pregnant at the time. He was initially charged as an adult, facing the prospect of life in prison without parole. But on August 23, 2011, Lawrence County Judge Dominick Motto reversed his earlier ruling so that Brown would instead face a juvenile proceeding. A judge later ordered that these upcoming proceedings must be closed to the public. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Pittsburgh Tribune-Review and New Castle News newspapers subsequently filed an appeal, arguing that the public has a constitutional right to access the courts even when juveniles are involved. Pennsylvania's Superior Court issued a 33-page ruling on Wednesday, that was obtained Friday by InSession from CNN's sister network truTV, regarding the appeal. The opinion, written by Judge Jacqueline Shogan, acknowledges that there \"has been some recent tendency to permit publicity (of) juvenile court proceedings on the theory that this will act as a curb to juvenile delinquency.\" But the court also expressed concerns that the harm caused by publicizing juvenile proceedings \"may be great.\" The order references an effort to maintain Jordan's privacy, finding that \"there is no alternative short of closure of the juvenile court proceedings\" that will do so. \"Closure of the juvenile proceedings, under the constitutional analysis, serves a compelling government interest and ... there is no less restrictive means to serve that interest,\" Shogan wrote in the opinion. Given the high-profile nature of the case, CNN is identifying Brown by name even though he is a juvenile. Investigators say Houk was killed with a bullet fired from a youth model 20-gauge shotgun that belonged to Brown. The pregnant woman's 4-year-old daughter found her in her bed, according to police. The girl alerted landscapers working near the home, who then called authorities. Brown, who was living with his father at the time of the shooting, was subsequently charged with one count each of criminal homicide and homicide of an unborn child. The charges were initially filed in an adult court because, according to Pennsylvania state law, anyone older than 10 who has committed a murder or homicide is automatically tried as an adult. The defense then must present a sufficient case to move a case to juvenile court. At the time, Brown was thought to be the youngest person facing a life sentence without the possibility of parole, according to an Amnesty International statement.

The Syrian Kurdish town of Kobani (Ayn al-Arab in Arabic) is an island, surrounded by ISIS on three fronts and the Turkish border to the north. The town was already mostly blockaded by ISIS, but in the past three days some 60 nearby villages fell under ISIS control, according to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or \"Islamic State,\" as the group calls itself, took 39 villages on Friday alone as Kurdish forces withdrew from their positions, the Observatory said. Clashes are constant around Kobani as Kurdish fighters attempt to hold off ISIS, which is armed with heavy artillery and tanks, Kurdish activist Mostafa Baly told CNN. \"Mobilization of people in Kobani is not enough,\" said Redur Xelil, a spokesman for the Kurdish fighters. \"The international community has to take action. If not, there will be a new (Sinjar) genocide, but this time in Kobani.\" Sinjar is the Iraqi city that came under ISIS attack last month, causing thousands to flee onto adjacent Mount Sinjar, where refugees became stranded and were starving before U.S. airstrikes helped pave a way for them to flee. The fighting around Kobani has been intense for four days, Xelil told CNN. Masoud Barzani, the President of the Kurdish Region in Iraq, called the ISIS attacks in northern Syria \"barbaric\" and described them as ethnic cleansing. \"I ask the international community to take every measure as soon as possible to save Kobani and the people of Syrian Kurdistan from the terrorists,\" he said in a statement. \"The ISIS terrorists perpetrate crimes and atrocities wherever they are, therefore they have to be hit and defeated wherever they are.\" As ISIS encroached on the nearby villages, residents fled toward Kobani, said Baly, the Kurdish activist. There were reports that ISIS kidnapped some of those fleeing to Kobani, including women, children and the elderly, Baly said. At least three rockets landed in Kobani, causing much panic, he said. \"There is a great deal of fear, but people are insisting on standing up to ISIS and remaining steadfast in the face of their attack,\" he said. Turkey opens border . The fear of a humanitarian crisis in Kobani rose as displaced people sought refuge there but became trapped between the fighting and the Turkish border. An estimated 3,000 to 4,000 Kurds fleeing the violence walked right up to the wire border fence with Turkey, where they initially were not allowed in. They just sat at the border as Turkish Kurds on the other side of the fence tried to persuade the Turkish guards to let them in. The situation on the border could be observed on a live feed from the border and from video footage aired on Turkish news outlets. The refugees also tried to force their way into Turkey, creating chaos as one woman stepped on a landmine. Turkey finally opened the border, relieving some of the mounting pressure in Kobani and allowing refugees to enter Sanliurfa province. \"Four thousand of our siblings will be hosted in our country,\" Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told state media. \"Opening our arms to our Syrian brothers is our historic humanitarian responsibility.\" Hosting Syrian refugees is nothing new for Turkey and other neighboring nations. About 815,000 registered Syrian refugees were in Turkey as of last month, part of the 3 million total registered Syrian refugees that the U.N. has counted amid Syria's three-year civil war. A further 6.5 million people were believed to be displaced within Syria as of last month, according to the U.N. U.S. military on deck . The U.S. Senate on Thursday voted overwhelmingly to approve the arming of Syrian rebels as top U.S. military leadership approved a plan to strike ISIS in Syria. The House approved Obama's request Wednesday. The approval allows President Barack Obama to carry out part of his stated strategy to combat ISIS, though some political leaders remain divided on the way forward. With approval in hand to arm and train Syrian rebels to fight ISIS, Obama said Thursday the plan keeps with \"the key principle\" of U.S. strategy: No American combat troops on the ground. \"The American troops deployed to Iraq do not and will not have a combat mission,\" he said in televised remarks from the White House. \"Their mission is to advise and assist our partners on the ground. ... We can destroy ISIL without having our troops fight another ground war in the Middle East.\" Obama said more than 40 countries, including Arab nations, have offered assistance in the battle against ISIS. Long vetting and training process . National Security Adviser Susan Rice, speaking to reporters Friday, said that now that approval to arm moderate Syrian rebels has been given, a long process will start to vet and train those who will be benefit from the measure. U.S. military personnel will train the Syrian fighters outside of Syria, and the process of planning the training and vetting the participants will take months, she said. \"This is a serious training program, and we are serious about vetting those we are training and equipping,\" she said. Rice stepped around questions about whether airstrikes against ISIS in Syria will require an additional thumbs-up from President Obama, repeating the President's own announcement that the United States is \"prepared\" to broaden its actions in the region into Syria. ISIS videos . The advance by ISIS in northern Syria comes as the Islamist group released a 55-minute English-language video warning America against \"direct confrontation.\" The video describes the conflict as a fight between believers and nonbelievers, and praises its successes on the battlefield. Earlier this week, ISIS released another video showing a captive British journalist criticizing the American and British governments. Citing the Sunni terror group's brutality, from beheading civilians -- including American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff -- to the mass execution of its opponents, Obama said the United States will not back down. \"With their barbaric murder of two Americans, these terrorists thought they could frighten us or intimidate us or cause us to shrink from the world,\" Obama said. \"But today, they are learning the same hard lesson of petty tyrants and terrorists who have gone before: As Americans, we do not give in to fear. When you harm our citizens, when you threaten the United States, when you threaten our allies, it doesn't frighten us. It unites us.\" The question now appears to be not if, but when, the United States will strike ISIS in its stronghold in northern Syria. The U.S. military has everything it needs to strike ISIS targets in Syria, a plan that officials told CNN is still waiting on Obama's signoff. ISIS, meanwhile, is modifying its behavior, from the way it communicates to the way it conceals itself, in response to potential U.S. airstrikes in Syria, U.S. military officials told CNN. The officials expressed confidence the airstrikes would be effective. Gul Tuysuz reported from Istanbul, and Mariano Castillo wrote and reported from Atlanta.

Mel Martinez, a Florida Republican, announced Friday that he will resign his seat as soon as a replacement can be named by the governor. Sen. Mel Martinez is the only Hispanic Republican in the U.S. Senate. \"My priorities have always been my faith, my family and my country, and, at this stage of my life and after nearly 12 years of public service in Florida and in Washington, it is time to return to Florida and my family,\" the 62-year-old said in Orlando, Florida. \"So today I am announcing my decision to step down from public office.\" Martinez said he is resigning \"of my own free will. There is no impending reason; it's only my desire to move on and to get on with the rest of my life.\" He added that he is in good health and that he expects the next phase of his life will take place in the private sector. \"However, I do hope that I can have a voice to speak out on issues I think are important,\" he said. Martinez added that he has no plans to run for any other public office. At a news conference at McDill Air Force Base in Florida, Gov. Charlie Crist said he will \"undertake a very thorough, comprehensive, thoughtful process\" to find a replacement for Martinez. He vowed not to appoint himself to complete Martinez's six-year term, which ends in about 17 months, and predicted that he would reach a decision before the Senate returns from recess September 8. Crist, a Republican, had announced in May that he would not seek a second term as governor and instead would run for Martinez's seat in the 2010 election. Martinez was elected in 2004. He announced in December his intention to retire at the end of his term. Martinez is the only Hispanic Republican in the Senate. He joined eight other Republicans on Thursday in voting to confirm Judge Sonia Sotomayor as the first Hispanic justice to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. Democrats hold a tenuous filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, with 60 votes. Martinez is one of six Republicans who have stated they would not seek re-election in 2010. But the Florida senator is the second Republican who has decided to leave before the curtain drops on the 111th Congress next fall. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, recently announced her intention to quit the Senate three years before her term expires, in order to run for governor next year. The five other Republicans who are retiring are Missouri Sen. Kit Bond, Kansas Sen. Sam Brownback, New Hampshire Sen. Judd Gregg, Kentucky Sen. Jim Bunning and Ohio Sen. George Voinovich.

Germany suffered an early blow in Port Elizabeth when leading striker Miroslav Klose was sent off for his second yellow card, shortly before Jovanovic fired Serbia in front. Lukas Podolski then saw his second half penalty, given following a handball by Nemanja Vidic, blocked by Serbian goalkeeper Vladimir Stojkovic. The result was perennial challengers Germany's first defeat at the group stage of a World Cup tournament since 1986, when then-West Germany were beaten by Denmark. That year, the three-times world champions went on to reach the final. It also marked the latest setback for the tournament's traditional giants following Switzerland's win over Spain and Mexico's win over France. German coach Joachim Loew admitted it was a big setback for his team. \"We had a lot of problems, the double yellow card for Klose, they got the first goal, then we failed to score from the penalty spot -- all in all it was difficult to come to terms with all this, \" he told AFP. \"We're devastated of course but I'm still confident we will go through to the last 16. we have our fate in our own hands still and a good goal difference.\" The result lifts Serbia's chances of qualifying from group D following their 1-0 defeat by Ghana in their opening game. They are now tied with Germany on three points following the Germans' 4-0 win over Australia. A win for Ghana over Australia on Saturday would put the west African side firmly on course for a place in the last 16 -- while a win for Australia would leave all four teams tied on three points . Match winner Jovanovic turned in Nikola Zigic's header from close range following good work down the right by the impressive Milos Krasic on 38 minutes. Two minutes earlier, Germany had been reduced to 10 men when Klose picked up his second yellow card of the game for a clumsy challenge on Dejan Stankovic. Klose, who is chasing Brazilian striker Ronaldo's record of 15 goals in World Cup tournaments, had earlier been booked for catching Branislav Ivanovic's ankles, and suspension will now rule him out of Germany's final group game against Ghana on June 23. But Klose appeared to be a victim of some fussy refereeing by Spanish official Alberto Undiano Mallenco, with seven other players also picking up bookings for minor offences. Germany came close to equalizing in the last minute of the half following a series of corners when Sami Khedira slammed a shot against the bar but Serbia's defenders scrambled away the rebound. Serbia, one of Europe's most impressive sides in World Cup qualifying, had seemed happy to concede possession and defend deep in the early stages with German midfielders Khedira and Mehsut Ozil struggling to find space in the center. Podolski flashed an early volley wide of the Serbian goal and Thomas Mueller combined neatly with Bastian Schweinsteiger on 30 minutes to play in Klose, but the German striker was called offside before putting the ball into the net. Serbia's main threat came from Krasic down the right, with Holger Badstuber and Philipp Lahm both picking up bookings for fouls on the CSKA Moscow midfielder. Aleksandar Kolarov went close from the second of those, clipping a freekick from the edge of the penalty area just wide of the post. Germany pressed hard for an equalizer early in the second half and looked to be back in the game when Serbian defender Nemanja Vidic was punished for a handball in the penalty area in a virtual repeat of the incident that saw his side concede a penalty in their opening defeat by Ghana. But Podolski's low shot was solidly blocked by goalkeeper Vladimir Stojkovic diving to his left. Podolski had already twice gone close, flashing a shot across the goal from Ozil's defense-splitting pass and then shooting into the side netting after being set up by the same player. Serbia almost increased their lead on 66 minutes when the ever dangerous Krasic cut in from the left to set up Jovanovic but the striker's low placed shot bounced to safety off the inside of the post. Zigic then glanced the top of the bar with a header, again from a cross from the right by Krasic.</td><td>Milan Jovanovic scores for Serbia from close range in first half .\n",

Samuel Eto'o scored twice, with the returning Wesley Sneijder, Thiago Motta and Esteban Cambiasso also on target as Leonardo's side moved up to third place in the table, five points behind leaders Milan but with a game in hand. Inter took a third minute lead when Sneijder fired home an unstoppable shot after collecting Maicon's pass but Roma levelled 10 minutes later when Simplicio turned in Marco Cassetti's cross. However, the home side went into the break 2-1 ahead when Eto'o fired a shot that slipped through the hands of goalkeeper Sergio. The game turned Inter's way early in the second half when Nicolas Burdisso was sent after fouling Giampaolo Pazzini in the area and Eto'o stroked home the penalty to take his season's tally to 27 goals in all competitions. And Inter Milan increased their lead even further when Motta headed home from close range. However, Roma fought back and Mirko Vucinic pulled one back when diverting home Daniele De Rossi's free-kick and they reduced the deficit to 4-3 when Simone Loria prodded home from close range after Juan's header struck the post. But there was to be no dramatic comeback and Inter secured their victory through Cambiasso's late goal. Milan dropped two points after behind held to a 1-1 draw at Genoa, despite Pato giving them a 29th minute lead from close range. However, Antonio Floro Flores levelled on the stroke of half time when he was on hand to fire home after Mathieu Flamini deflected the ball into his path.

A temporary worker at this Wal-Mart was crushed to death when shoppers rushed into the store last week. Temporary Wal-Mart worker Jdimytai Damour, 34, was crushed to death as he and other employees attempted to unlock the doors of a store on Long Island at 5 a.m. Friday. Attorney Kenneth Mollins said Fritz Mesadieu and Jonathan Mesadieu were \"literally carried from their position outside the store\" and are now \"suffering from pain in their neck and their back from being caught in that surge of people\" that rushed into the Wal-Mart. New York Newsday reported that the Mesadieus are father and son, ages 51 and 19. The lawsuit alleges that the Mesadieus' injuries were a result of \"carelessness, recklessness, negligence.\" In a claim against the Nassau County police department, the men also contend that they \"sustained monetary losses as a result of health care and legal expenses ... in the sum of $2 million.\" \"This is a tragic situation that could have and should have been avoided with the exercise of reasonable care. There are very simple measures that could have been put in place to avoid this, such as barriers along the line to spread people out, extra security and a better police presence,\" Mollins said. He said his clients and others who were at the scene contend that the police \"were there ... saw what was happening, and they left.\" Calls seeking comment from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. were not immediately returned. Lt. Kevin Smith of the Nassau County Police Department said, \"it's our policy that we don't comment on open litigations\" and would not respond directly to Mollins and his clients' claim that officers left the scene. He said it is \"incumbent upon the store to provide security\" but noted that there was no security force present when officers responded to an initial phone call after 3 a.m. Friday for an unknown disturbance at the site. Smith said the officers noticed a lack of order with the crowd and began to organize them into a line, remaining on site for about 30 minutes until the crowd had become orderly. Throughout the morning, officers went back to check on the crowd and continued to notice no disturbance, Smith said. He said that there were no additional calls for assistance until about 5 a.m., when people began rushing the doors of the store and trampled Damour. An autopsy showed that Damour died of asphyxiation after being trampled, Nassau County officials have said. Video showed that as many as a dozen people were knocked to the floor in the stampede of people trying to get into the store.

Marshall thought to himself: What if you had a camera as small as a remora? What if you could stick a camera on a shark so that the shark goes about its life, unaware that its actions were being recorded away from the distractions of photographers in scuba suits? Where would it go, and what would you see? For a naturalist, being able to observe animal behavior without interfering with the world the animal inhabits by the simple act of being there is the gold standard. In scientific terms, it's similar to a control in an experiment. But that goal is usually unobtainable -- observing how an animal acts in captivity, for example, is no indication of how an animal actually behaves. Observing that behavior in the wild, Marshall says, is equally problematic. \"When we're in an animal's habitat, they know we're there,\" he says. \"And they're reacting to us.\" And knowledge of an animal's actual behavior, Marshall says, is absolutely critical to reaching the correct conclusions about a creature's habitat and behavior, and how humans may be disrupting both. Of course, the best way to observe real behavior in the wild is to have omniscient powers of observation, or perhaps a camera lens as long as your arm and as expensive as a new car. Or you can see what the animal sees, courtesy of \"Crittercam.\" Twenty-five years after that underwater epiphany in the waters off Belize, Marshall and his far-flung team of naturalists and engineers are getting closer to that gold standard. Technology may finally be catching up with inspiration. Marshall took his initial ideas for ride-along observation technology to the National Geographic Society in 1987. Now he's vice president of the society's Remote Imaging division -- an effort by a team of scientists and engineers working with researchers around the globe capturing footage of how animals behave in the wild, away from the interference of the observers. \"Crittercam enables us to get out of the picture entirely -- to ride along, almost completely unobtrusively, to see their world and their behavior,\" he says. Marshall is a real-deal explorer, a tall, lanky, gregarious type who seems more suited to a dive boat in the Sea of Cortez or a snowmobile in Antarctica than an impressively equipped machine shop in the basement of the fabled headquarters of the National Geographic Society. Marshall still gets more than his fair share of exploration -- a day after this interview, he was off to Antarctica, again. But more often he's back in Washington, at his desk or in an edit bay. Still, adventure is where you find it -- and sometimes, it's in the most unlikely of places. Cracking open a newly recovered Crittercam remora (or box, or sphere, or whatever device his crew of happily mad scientists invent to capture hitherto-unwitnessed moments in nature) is, for Marshall, full of the rush of exploration. When Crittercam got its start, the results of all the hard work came down to a small, fragile tape. Nowadays, the data is stored on a tough, solid-state memory card. But seeing the data of the first time, Marshall says, is always a rush. \"You start looking at the screen because you never know what you're going to see. It's completely engaging and captivating,\" he says. The results, Marshall says, run the gamut from inspiring and revelatory to downright boring -- at least, boring to a typical National Geographic Channel viewer. But to a marine biologist like Marshall, even the \"boring\" stuff can have stop-in-your-tracks potential. Case in point: Sperm whales. They are one of the deepest-diving species on the planet. Years ago, his crew successfully attached an advanced Crittercam to a diving sperm whale. \"The first 10 seconds are fascinating, because you see the whale diving down,\" Marshall says. \"And then it dives down into utter darkness. And then we're looking at a black screen for the next two hours.\" But that Crittercam was also equipped to record sound, as well as video. And in that utter blackness (sperm whales can dive almost two miles down), the Crittercam whale began a conversation with another whale -- a cascade of powerful, rapid-fire clicks. That whale conversation kept Marshall and his editors transfixed. It wasn't a made-for-TV moment, but it was yet more evidence that just about every deployment of the Crittercam system can reap unexpected rewards. In the frigid waters off Alaska, a Crittercam captured an intimate view of a humpback whale calf nursing. There's dizzying footage of a tree kangaroo (yes, there's a kangaroo that climbs trees) high in the jungle canopy of New Guinea. A sea lion in Australia plays with its food -- in this case, a hapless octopus. There's even a brief glimpse of a great white shark swimming at eye-popping speed, chasing an equally quick seal. \"You just never know what you're going to get -- it's just completely engaging,\" he says with a broad grin. Crittercam footage finds its way into many of National Geographic's nature programs. And the best Crittercam moments are a rare combination of good television and good science. That's partly the goal of the whole program, Marshall says. \"I want to find a way to connect with people, I want to find a way to make them care about the conservation problem,\" Marshall says. \"Imagine a planet where there are no humpback whales, where there are no blue whales, no leopard seals, no leatherback turtles. Can we survive? Absolutely we can survive... Well, probably. \"Is it going to be the kind of place we're going to revel in, that's going to inspire us? I doubt it. As we know more, we're going to care more -- and as we care more, we're going to protect these animals and the habitats they depend on.\"</td><td>For a naturalist, observing animals in the wild is key to learning about species .\n",

But there's fresh evidence that one of the planet's most recognizable features, the Great Red Spot, is shrinking. NASA's Cassini spacecraft photographed Jupiter and its Great Red Spot, seen center near the equator, in 2000. The spot, which is actually an ancient monster storm that measures about three Earths across, lost 15 percent of its diameter between 1996 and 2006, scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, have found. It shrank by about 1 kilometer (about 0.6 miles) a day during that time period, said Xylar Asay-Davis, a postdoctoral researcher who was part of the study. Astronomers have observed for years that the clouds of the Great Red Spot have been waning, but this newest research focused on the motion of the storm -- a much more reliable way to measure its size, Asay-Davis said. He and fellow Berkeley researchers Philip Marcus, Imke de Pater, Michael Wong and Sushil Shetty developed software that tracked the movement of the spot's cloud patterns over long periods of time. \"It's not just the motion of the spot as a whole object. Within it, it has a very complicated swirl to it -- sort of a thin ring on the outside and then a sort of quiet area in the center -- and that shape of it has been changing over time,\" Asay-Davis said. \"What we actually look at is where the winds are the strongest in the vortex. It's the ring where they're the strongest, and that ring has been shrinking over time.\" The findings have been submitted for publication in Icarus, the International Journal of Solar System Studies.  See photos of the other planets and find out what makes them stand out » . What makes it red? The researchers do not know why the storm is shrinking. In fact, little is known about the Great Red Spot at all. Even the exact cause of its distinctive color is a mystery. \"We don't actually know what causes any of the colors on Jupiter,\" said Amy Simon-Miller, chief of the Planetary Systems Lab at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"One of the leading theories is that [the storm] is dredging up stuff from much deeper below in the atmosphere that turns red when it's exposed to sunlight.\" The spot isn't always bright red; sometimes it's actually quite pale, Simon-Miller noted. Astronomers have been tracking it since the 1870s, said Glenn Orton, a senior research scientist at NASA'S Jet Propulsion Laboratory who investigates planetary atmospheres. It is possible that the spot may one day disappear, he added. \"It's just a storm that, like many things, has a natural growth and disintegration rate,\" Orton said. Astronomers see a dramatic difference in the spot's shape when comparing photos of Jupiter taken more than a century ago to recent images of the planet. Orton joked that the Great Red Spot used to be so long that its acronym should have stood for the \"Great Red Sausage.\" \"I just happened to look at an old picture and said to myself, 'That looks like a breakfast sausage.' It's very long. I mean, if you look at one of those pictures back from then and a picture now, you think, 'My God, this thing is going on a diet,\" Orton said. Now eye-shaped, the spot is expected to become circular by about 2040, he added. Chemical stew . The storm is a fascinating feature on a fascinating planet. It has some of the characteristics of a hurricane on Earth, including a circular motion and strong winds. They're Jupiter-strength inside the spot, with some gusting up to 400 miles per hour, Simon-Miller said. Unlike hurricanes on Earth, which are low-pressure systems, the Great Red Spot is a high-pressure system, so it's more stable -- one of the reasons it has lasted so long, she added. Another factor in its longevity is that there is no land on Jupiter to slow a storm in the way landfalls cause hurricanes to lose steam on Earth. Jupiter's atmosphere of colorful dots, swirls and bands may look like an impressionist painting from above, but it would quickly lose its beauty on closer approach. The clouds visible from space consist of ammonia ice and ammonium hydrosulfide -- a sort of smoggy chemical stew -- and the conditions below are brutal, especially inside the Great Red Spot. \"The winds are so strong, everything would get pulled apart pretty quickly. There's no surface to stand on and look up at it,\" Simon-Miller said. Probes sent by NASA towards the interior of the planet have been crushed by the gas giant's enormous atmospheric pressure. Still, the images of Jupiter and its Great Red Spot mesmerize astronomers. \"The pictures are just so beautiful, and they're different every single time we look,\" Simon-Miller said.</td><td>Scientists: Great Red Spot lost 15 percent of its diameter between 1996 and 2006 .\n",

But, oddly enough, the anger and frustration isn't usually aimed at the illegal immigrants themselves. Many Arizonans would probably admit that, if they were unable to feed their families in their home country, they too might venture out in search of employment. And, if they were faced with waits of 10 to 15 years to enter another country legally, you can bet many of them would enter illegally. What really gets Arizonans fired up are three things: the feeling that they're under siege by spillover violence from Mexican drug cartels, the concern that the U.S. government isn't doing enough to protect them, and indignation that people in other states are judging them for responding to a reality most of us can't imagine. That's what you hear on talk radio and what you read in the letters section of local newspapers. And that's also pretty much the view of Jay Heiler, a top-notch political and public affairs consultant and a familiar fixture in Arizona Republican circles. Heiler served as chief of staff to former Gov. Fife Symington in the 1990s and counsels Gov. Jan Brewer today. He's a vocal defender of the state's new immigration law, Senate Bill 1070. What I wanted to know is whether that's because he really believes in the measure or whether he's just being a good soldier for the state GOP, given that just about every prominent Republican official in the state backs the law. As we met for what became a three-hour dinner in a Phoenix restaurant, I soon had my answer. Heiler began the conversation with a piece of advice. \"If you're going to write about this issue with credibility,\" he said, \"you have to acknowledge the reality of the violence caused by the Mexican drug cartels and the inability of the Mexican government to contain it.\" Not this again. The new bogeyman of the immigration debate is the Mexican drug cartels. In fact, when you engage a supporter of SB 1070, it's hard to get them to talk about anything else. The cartels are their strong card; why not play it? One of the arguments floating about -- advanced by Brewer -- is that most illegal immigrants act as drug mules for the cartels. Too bad Brewer can't seem to find anyone to back that up. Arizona Sen. John McCain said he doesn't believe that most illegal immigrants are used as drug mules. Neither does T.J. Bonner, head of the National Border Patrol Council, the labor union representing nearly 20,000 border patrol agents. Bonner said Brewer's claims are \"clearly not the case\" and \"don't comport with reality.\" Heiler is too smart to repeat wild claims. Instead, he stayed focused on public perception. He submits that most of the support for the measure --- polls show that about 55 percent of Arizonans back the law, down from 70 percent when Brewer signed it in April -- is coming from people who are sincerely afraid that Mexico is spinning out of control because of the drug war and that the chaos is spilling into Arizona in the form of kidnappings and other lawlessness. According to law enforcement authorities, in 2008, nearly 400 kidnappings happened in Phoenix. But a prosecutor told me that most people don't understand that many of these \"kidnappings\" aren't for ransom. Rather, they're an extension of the human smuggling industry, in which rival coyotes raid each other's \"drop houses\" and steal the cargo. That's a serious crime, and yet it's probably not what most people think about when they hear the word \"kidnapping.\" Phoenix Police Chief Jack Harris, a vocal opponent of the immigration law, insists that he has the manpower to investigate each kidnapping. But, he warns, that could change if the portions of SB 1070 struck down by a federal judge come back to life like the mythical bird that shares the city's name. If his officers have to make immigration enforcement their top priority, Harris said, other crimes will probably go unsolved. Then, the crime rate could soar. Right now, the crime rate in Phoenix is down. The Phoenix Police Department confirms it. \"Despite all the hype,\" spokesman Trent Crump told the Wall Street Journal, \"in every single reportable crime category, we're significantly down.\" In the first quarter of 2010, violent crime was down 17 percent in the city, while homicides were down 38 percent and robberies 27 percent, compared with the same time period in 2009. The  Federal Bureau of Investigation also confirms it. The number of violent crimes has fallen every year in Phoenix since 2006, the FBI reports. It's part of an overall trend in which, according to the bureau, crime rates are actually going down in cities that have large immigrant populations . It's pretty obvious that cynical politicians -- all of whom happen to be Republicans -- are exaggerating the fear factor to cover up what they recognize as some of the more unseemly motives of SB 1070 supporters. Although Heiler doesn't deny that some of the folks who have rallied around the law are motivated by anxiety over changing demographics, he wouldn't admit that this has anything to do with race and ethnicity. But isn't that obvious? For the past two decades, there has been a loud chorus of worry about how Latino immigrants are changing Phoenix -- and, according to some, not for the better. Those feelings didn't just go away. And the people who hold them are almost certainly part of the pro-1070 brigade. Not everyone who wants to get rid of illegal immigrants does so because he or she sees a connection to the drug cartels. In fact, most people just want to preserve the America they grew up with. Besides, if they really want to put drug dealers out of business, the best way is to support Mexican President Felipe Calderon, who has declared war on these criminal syndicates and yet vehemently opposes the Arizona law. Instead, Republican candidates for office are running TV ads in Arizona criticizing Calderon for criticizing the law. That makes absolutely no sense, just as it makes no sense for Arizona to crack down on illegal immigrants in the hopes that it will somehow get rid of drug dealers. Unless, of course, the real objective all along has been something much sneakier: to use the fear of drug dealers to get rid of illegal immigrants.

The suit also seeks reforms to the Los Angeles Unified School District, which \"has a practice and custom of maintaining a 'Culture of Silence' to hide teacher misconduct, and to ignore teacher misconduct,\" the suit said. The legal action stems from a criminal case against former teacher Mark Berndt of Miramonte Elementary, who is being held on $23 million bond and faces 23 felony counts of lewd acts on children. Berndt, 61, pleaded not guilty in February to allegations he bound young students, then photographed them with semen-filled spoons held at their mouths and three-inch cockroaches crawling across their faces, among other graphic depictions. L.A. schools review past 40 years of teacher discipline cases in misconduct crisis . The 23 victims were between 7 and 10 years old, and all but two of them were girls, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said. The 14 mothers' lawsuit says Berndt took photographs of their children \"with cookies in the mouths of plaintiff's children, and/or blindfolded the children, and/or placed cockroaches on the bodies of plaintiff's children, for the intent of arousing and gratifying the lust, passions and sexual desires of Mark Berndt.\" One of two mothers who spoke at a press conference on Tuesday said her now 10-year-old daughter was victimized by Berndt while a student at Miramonte from 2009 to 2010. CNN, which has interviewed the mother in recent months, isn't identifying the mother or other parents in order to protect the identities of the children. \"I am asking for justice and I want justice to be done to this man,\" the mother, 43, said. She wants the district to be held accountable for its \"negligence,\" she said. In a recent CNN interview, the mother said her daughter went to Berndt's classroom, where \"he would give her some cookies. My daughter told me that the teacher would say the cookies had sugar and some white stuff that was on it,\" the mother said. In that CNN interview, the mother was joined by her daughter, who told CNN: \"We would help him clean his class and he would give us cookies. \"They were white and they had a white stuff on top, and he would put some sort of powder\" on the cookie, the girl said. The parents told CNN they didn't tell their daughter what could have been on the cookie. The girl's father, 46, who joined his wife at Tuesday's press conference, told CNN the couple doesn't want money but rather justice, so other families won't \"suffer what's happening to us,\" the dad said. Their daughter is now enrolled at another school. The daughter and mother are both in counseling, he said. \"We don't want money, because our children's health physically and mentally is not going to be the same,\" the father said. California teacher pleads not guilt in student 'bondage' case . The other mother at Tuesday's press conference told reporters that her daughter is now rebellious and is also in counseling. Five of the children in the civil lawsuit are among the 23 alleged victims in the criminal case, said Luis A. Carrillo, the attorney for the 14 mothers. Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives are investigating the accusations of the nine other children identified as victims in the civil suit, Carrillo said. Sheriff's Lt. Carlos Marquez, the lead investigator in the case, said Tuesday that detectives interviewed more than 100 Miramonte students and have presented all those cases to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office for review. It's up to the district attorney whether to bring charges on behalf of additional victims, beyond the current 23, Marquez said. Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office, declined to comment Tuesday on whether additional charges would be filed. Berndt's attorney, public defender Victor Acevedo, declined to comment Tuesday because he hadn't seen the lawsuit. David Holmquist, general counsel for the Los Angeles school district, said student safety was the system's \"paramount priority.\" \"The district is committed to working with the Miramonte community and everyone impacted by these incidents to improve trust and promote healing,\" Holmquist said in a statement. \"While the district has yet to receive the latest complaint, we are continuing our efforts to ensure that we are doing everything possible to provide a safe learning and working environment for our students and staff.\" In May, another civil lawsuit was filed against the school district on behalf of 22 children who claimed they were sexually abused by Berndt, said Carrillo, who also is the attorney for the plaintiffs in that case. The lawsuit, also filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, alleged that Berndt \"engaged in sexual assault, sexual harassment, which includes sex discrimination per LAUSD's policies, and/or sexual exploitation of the plaintiffs that included lewd, obscene and/or lascivious acts\" with the 22 children age 6 to 9 years old between 2002 and 2011, court papers said. The children of the 14 mothers in Tuesday's lawsuit are also part of the May lawsuit, Carrillo said. In December 2010, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department began investigating Berndt after authorities learned of hundreds of \"questionable photographs of children on film that Mr. Berndt had brought (to) a local store to have developed,\" according to Tuesday's lawsuit. Berndt was removed from his teaching job in January 2011 after school officials learned of the police investigation, authorities said. Authorities have said they have discovered roughly 600 images allegedly taken by Berndt in his classroom. A teacher for 30 years, Berndt initially challenged the school district's decision to dismiss him. But he eventually dropped his appeal and resigned in spring 2011. His arrest in January led to broader fallout over the adequacy of safeguards for the school's students and the prospect of more victims. Days after Berndt was taken into custody, another Miramonte Elementary teacher -- Martin Springer, 49 -- was arrested and charged with three felony counts of lewd acts with a girl younger than 14. He has pleaded not guilty. The Los Angeles Unified School District board subsequently shut Miramonte for two days, during which the board reconstituted the entire staff in the 1,400-student school. Miramonte is in unincorporated Los Angeles County within the Florence-Firestone area, about six miles south of downtown Los Angeles.

The Chardon High School freshman was walking with friends when they heard a loud pop. He looked up. \"I looked straight ahead and I saw a gun pointing at a group of four guys sitting a table ... He just fired two quick shots at them. I saw one student fall, and I saw the other hiding, trying to get cover underneath the table,\" Komertz told CNN. \"He was aiming right at them as he was two feet away ... He wasn't shooting around the cafeteria at all. He was directly aiming at the four of them,\" he said. Komertz was lucky; he wasn't hit. Five others were when a young man allegedly opened fire on that table of students in the Chardon High School cafeteria, killing one and seriously injuring four. Police arrested the suspected shooter a short time later. They have identified him as a juvenile, and witnesses told CNN the gunman was T.J. Lane, a student. Komertz, 15, said he heard some five shots -- the last two as he and his friends were running out the doors toward safety. \"I was very scared of what was going to happen so I didn't look at his face. I just looked at the gun and I ran,\" he said. Another witness, Nate Mueller, had his ear grazed by one of the gunman's bullets. He was sitting at a table next to the suspected shooter. \"All of a sudden we heard a loud bang, almost like a firework. We turned around and I saw T.J. standing at the table behind us with his gun pointed and firing,\" said Mueller. \"His first shot made me look. His second shot I watched him take, which hit somebody behind me, and his third shot hit me as I was turning away.\" Mueller described the gunman as stoic and silent. As he unloaded his weapon, his face was \"expressionless,\" Mueller said. \"There was no warning or anything. He just opened fire.\" Other students recalled being further away from the shooting, but no less scared. Josh Sophacak was walking outside the cafeteria when the first shot fired. \"It sounded like a firecracker ... I paused and everything went into slow motion from there. I guess I was in shock,\" he said. Yet for all the misery caused by Monday's shooting, witnesses have also described the makings of a hero. Assistant football coach and study hall teacher Frank Hall chased the gunman out of the school, they said. \"Coach Hall, he always talks about how much he cares about us students, his team and everyone.

For the first time, big winners in Spain's annual Christmas lottery will have to pay a 20% tax on their winnings if the prize is greater than 2,500 euros, or $3,425. In Spain's deep economic crisis, the government started taxing all major lottery winnings in 2013 and expects to collect about $1 billion this year. On Sunday alone, in the annual Christmas lottery that will pay out about $3 billion in prize money, the government anticipates collecting tens of millions of dollars in taxes, the Treasury Ministry told CNN. Most of the prizes are relatively small, but the lucky ones holding part of the $875 million (640 million euro) first place prize, known as El Gordo -- \"the fat one\" -- will face the tax bite. A $27.40 (20 euro) lottery ticket that matches all the numbers of the first place El Gordo prize would win $548,000 (400,000 euros), but the winner would have to pay $109,000 (80,000 euros) in taxes, the Treasury Ministry said. Spaniards typically spend 20 euros or less to buy a share of a full ticket, trying to spread the purchase among friends or family, at the local bar or at the workplace. But Spain's economic crisis and unemployment rate, which still tops 25%, has not spared the lottery, whose intake has declined for five consecutive years, according to the Spanish Gaming Yearbook 2012-2013. The lottery officially began in 1892. Year after year, the biggest winner is the state, which keeps $1.3 billion -- or 30% -- of the entire lottery intake, which reached $4.3 billion this year. The remaining 70% is distributed for prizes.</td><td>Big winners in Spain's annual Christmas lottery will have to pay a 20% tax .\n",

That was the defiant message from Barcelona's new president, who is adamant that the club's all-time leading goalscorer is going nowhere amid reports French club Paris St Germain want to sign the Argentine. Josep Maria Bartomeu will sit down with the four-time World Player of the Year to thrash out a new contract which will see him remain as most highly-paid at the Camp Nou. \"We want to sit down, without any rush, with Leo's father -- it's not something that's happening tomorrow, we have plenty of time, but we will do what we have to to ensure he's the best paid player,\" said Josep Maria Bartomeu, who assumed control at Barca after Sandro Rosell's resignation last week. Messi arrived at Barca in 2000 , graduating through the club's youth system before going on to establish himself as the best player on the planet. Since making his first team debut in 2004, Messi has helped the team win six Spanish league titles, two Spanish Cups and three European Champions League crowns. Blog: Is Ronaldo really the best?

The club initially announced the deal was worth $78 million, but the breakdown of the agreement was never revealed. A Barcelona member launched a case against Rosell for not disclosing the full details and the club was asked by Spanish authorities to hand over documentation, as well as accounts for the past three years. Bartomeu, who will continue as president until the end of the current term, which finishes in 2016, explained that he spoke with senior players at the club before discussing details of Neymar's contract at a previous press conference. \"I explained to the captains that we would be showing details of Neymar's contract,\" said the former vice president. \"We have to be grateful to Neymar that he came here, when he could have earned more money at other clubs.\"</td><td>Lionel Messi is not for sale, says Barcelona president .\n",

Deval Patrick told reporters Tuesday. In addition, the Board of Registration in Pharmacy has voted to revoke permanently the New England Compounding Center's license to operate in Massachusetts as well as the licenses of the company's three principal pharmacists, Patrick said. The announcements came in the wake of a damning nine-page report, released Tuesday by the board, which is part of the state's Department of Public Health. Investigators for the state's DPH, working with their counterparts at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, \"identified serious deficiencies and significant violations of pharmacy law and regulations that clearly placed the public's health at risk,\" it said. According to the investigator's preliminary findings, the Compounding Center: . -- Distributed large quantities of its products to facilities, \"apparently for general use rather than requiring a prescription for an individual patient\" as state law requires. -- Distributed two recalled lots of methylprednisolone acetate before it had learned the results of sterility tests. -- Did not follow proper sterilization standards. -- Produced vials of methylprednisolone that were later recalled that contained \"visible black particulate matter.\" -- Failed to thoroughly clean powder hoods, which are intended to protect pharmacists from inhaling substances while medication is being prepared, which \"may subsequently lead to contamination of compounded medications.\" -- Used \"visibly soiled\" mats outside \"clean rooms,\" potentially leading to their contamination. -- Failed to repair a leaking boiler adjacent to the clean room, which resulted in a pool of water around the boiler and adjacent walls creating an unsanitary condition. Patrick said the state would begin making unannounced inspections of pharmacies that prepare injectable medications and require that they submit annual reports detailing what they produce, how much of it and where it is distributed. \"It is now clear that the New England Compounding Center violated state law and endangered the health of countless patients,\" said U.S. Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Massachusetts, in a statement. The senior member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over the FDA, vowed to introduce legislation to improve safety of drugs made by compounding pharmacies. The incident began unfolding on September 24, when the department said it was notified about a cluster of six rare fungal meningitis cases in Tennessee. The patients shared several risk factors, including an epidural injection of a steroid -- methylprednisolone acetate 80 mg/ml preservative free -- that had been compounded at NECC in Framingham, Massachusetts. The department soon learned that the suspect product had been distributed to more than 14,000 patients in 23 states. Investigators arriving at the company on September 26 \"found NECC employees cleaning sterile compounding areas and and conducting environmental testing,\" the report says. \"DPH investigators also detected signs of bleach decontamination in the compounding areas.\" DPH has asked two other companies -- Ameridose and Alaunus Pharmaceutical -- to cease all pharmacy operations based on their shared ownership and leadership with New England Compounding Center. On October 15, federal authorities said that another NECC steroid injection, triamcinolone acetonide, might have caused a patient to acquire fungal meningitis, and they began contacting all 192 state facilities that received any NECC injectable products. Three days later, the FDA confirmed that sealed vials of methylprednisolone acetate had been contaminated with fungi. On Monday, the board authorized DPH staff to seek the permanent surrender of the licenses of the NECC principals, who are prohibited from practicing pharmacy throughout any appeals. \"NECC's transparency in dealing with the board since inception in 1998 demonstrates its good faith intention to operate in compliance with the requirements of its license,\" said Paul Cirel, a Boston-based lawyer representing the compounder, in a statement on Tuesday. \"Furthermore, the company's intention and best efforts at compliance are equally applicable in every other state in which it has been licensed.\" Tuesday's events came a day after the Food and Drug Administration posted on its website a list of more than 1,200 hospitals and clinics that it said had purchased drugs from the compounding center that, if contaminated, would be especially dangerous. But the agency took down the list after discovering inaccuracies. \"FDA has found some technical problems with the list and the data are incorrect,\" the agency said in a statement on its website. \"FDA is working to correct the list and will re-post when we are sure it is accurate.\" Tennessee has been the hardest-hit state in the meningitis outbreak, with 70 cases as of Tuesday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Michigan is a close second, with 68 cases as of Tuesday. In all, 308 cases have been tallied.

Mescher, 27, was at the home of his host family when the 8.8-magnitude quake struck early Saturday. He was talking with friends on his computer when the power went out. Immediately after, he felt a subtle vibration that progressed into a violent shaking, he said. His host mom cried as the walls around them shook and her daughter attempted to comfort her, he said. \"They were \"paralyzed with fear,\" he said. \"I was like, we don't have time for this,\" Mescher said. \"We need to get the hell out of here.\" He grabbed his head lamp, the two women, and ran barefoot and bare-chested into the dark street. The three met dozens others in the staircase scurrying out the 20-story apartment building, he said. The exit was \"surprisingly orderly,\" Mescher said. But others faced more of an ordeal. CNN iReporter Matias de Cristobal said the earthquake destroyed many homes in her Santiago neighborhood. Cristobal tried to climb upstairs to check on her three children -- age 6, 9, and 11 -- after she began feeling tremors on Saturday, but she was slowed by shifting ground and falling objects. Mirko Vukasovic, a 25-year-old illustrator in Santiago, had been dancing at a club early Saturday when the disco ball began swinging wildly. A chaotic evacuation was under way when the lights went out, but everyone managed to escape, Vukasovic said. \"Broken windows and falling building parts was what welcomed us in the streets,\" he said. iReport: Read Mescher's firsthand account . Vukasovic submitted iReport video showing the damage to his fourth-floor apartment. \"What used to be a beautiful bathroom is now torn, a beautiful crack,\" he said as his camera panned to a pile of tile and plaster that had been shaken loose from the walls. Some in Chile reacted to the quake with disbelief. \"It was 3 or 4 in the morning and I had come home late,\" said Aneya Fernando, an American who teaches English in Santiago. \"Suddenly my bed was moving so violently that it woke me up.\" \"I'm on the 10th floor of a building and it was swaying and shaking,\" Fernando, 23, said. \"Suddenly it was just gone and I was confused. I thought it was in my head.\" When Fernando's electricity returned 30 minutes later, she learned of the earthquake on TV. Scott Ireland, a business traveler from Rochester, New York, who was staying at the Sheraton San Cristobal when the earthquake struck, submitted iReport photos of cracks in the exterior walls of his hotel. Ireland, 48, had experienced two earlier earthquakes -- one in Turkey in 1966 and another in Southern California in 1971. \"Not only was this the most severe,\" he said, \"the duration was longer than anything I'd ever experienced. Luckily the damage here was minimal.\" Meschler, the Iowa student, encountered faces of confusion and concern when he and his host family left their apartment building and entered the street. Some tried using their phones to call out with no luck, others ran to neighboring apartment complexes, looking to help. iReport: Watch video of damage at an apartment . Many throughout the city don't have their basic utilities, the Salvation Army reported. Mescher doesn't have gas, but his power and water are back on. The elderly seemed most frazzled by the rattling, he said. One elderly man had suffered a wound to his head. When the aftershocks began and kept rolling in jolts to his Santiago neighborhood, Mescher said some neighbors prepared for a night outside of their home. \"I did see a good portion of people go back upstairs an hour into it and put together what they could,\" he said, speaking of a sleep away bag. \"There were a lot of people that got their car and took off.\" Mescher had also tested his luck, considering he was unsure of the building's stability after such a great temblor. \"After we were safely outside I made a quick run and grabbed a shirt and some shoes,\" he said. About 5 a.m. (3 a.m. ET) -- about 90 minutes after the quake -- he returned to the apartment to finally get some rest, just to be rattled by another aftershock. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, a 6.9-magnitude aftershock hit Chile about that time. Dozens of aftershocks later, Mescher was looking at cracks that had shaped around the door frames and crept up walls. Chunks of plaster littered the floors, he said. \"I've got to think there have to be some long-term structural issues,\" he said. \"For the time being, I don't think it's going to fall on top of me.\"</td><td>NEW: CNN iReporter says many homes destroyed in her Santiago neighborhood .\n",

Would you go back and kill Hitler before the Holocaust? Arrest Oswald before JFK was assassinated? Stop Bin Laden before the 9/11 attacks? Of course you would. But what if you had to stand by and let those events unfold in order to achieve a more perfect future? That's the premise posed in \"The Revisionists,\" a new time-travel thriller from award-winning author, Thomas Mullen. In the future, there's no hunger, no war, no crime. At least, that's what we're led to believe. It's Zed's job to keep it that way. He's been sent back in time, to something similar to our present, to protect the integrity of the future timeline. To do that, Zed has to make sure that an imminent disaster of epic proportions, called \"The Great Conflagration\" happens just as history says it will, or does, or did. In his mission, Zed faces off with other time travelers, enemy agents called Hags, short for historical agitators, who want to prevent this apocalypse. Along the way, Zed crosses paths with an eclectic cast of characters, including a young Washington lawyer seeking answers about her brother, a soldier killed in Iraq; a disgraced former CIA agent; and a young Indonesian woman trapped as an indentured servant to a North Korean diplomat. Soon cracks start to appear in the timeline and Zed starts to doubt his mission. Don't let the description of the plot mislead you, this is not your typical sci-fi novel. Mullen is less concerned with the intricacies of time travel, focusing more on the nature of history and how it's shaped. As the saying goes, \"History is written by the victors\" -- but what if there were no winners in this scenario? In \"The Revisionists,\" Mullen presents a compelling and complex page-turner, a paranoid thriller for the post-9/11 age. CNN recently sat down with Mullen to talk about his new book; the following is an edited transcript: . CNN: What was the spark that led to this book? Mullen: There were a lot of sparks. It's a book that involves different narratives. I'd had the idea of this guy who comes back from the future and has to prevent bad things from happening. He's justifying his bad means because there's going to be a perfect end. I just thought that was an intriguing moral angle. I thought it was fun and I thought it had interesting interplay with the idea of intelligence agencies occasionally doing bad things but saying, oh it's for a good cause. I'd heard a story about this issue of domestic servants basically being kept as slaves in these really nice houses in D.C. because their bosses are diplomats who can hide behind diplomatic immunity, and I thought that was a really interesting idea but I wasn't sure what I was going to do with it. I was also interested in the idea of intelligence agents, either governmental or private, following peace activists, because that was happening. It's not legal, it's not supposed to happen, but you hear stories about police officers, mysterious agents, agent provocateurs with a group of peace activists, trying to get them all amped up so they would do something wrong so they could get arrested. You'd like to think these things don't happen, but you keep hearing about things like that happening. I thought that would be an intriguing story. So, I was kind of juggling these different ideas, then I put it aside, but I still, every now and then, would work on it. There were a lot of false starts with this. It took me a while to get some of these threads together in a way that I liked them. There were these different stories that I liked that I wanted to figure out and I asked myself, is this one book? Do these things go together; do I need to cut some of them out? I did end up cutting out some of the activist stuff, but I wanted to find a way to thread these different narratives together and see if it could all come together. It may have been a little messy but I hope in the end it worked. CNN: You really play with the idea of \"history\" in your book. Mullen: As somebody who has previously written two historical novels, in a lot of ways this book is a departure for me. At the same time this book is sort of about history, how it's formed and how we are products of our own history. The question comes up in the book; do we control our own fate? Can we make our own history or are we just pawns? That taps into this conspiracist view of the world that created a lot of great fiction and film in the 1970 like \"All the President's Men\" and \"The Conversation.\" There's this sense that there's this vast conspiracy of forces controlling us, that the government is listening to everything we do and there's nothing we can do about it. It's easy to think that way, especially now, but at the same time we also believe we're a country where a skinny interracial kid ... can become president. You never really know what's going to happen; you never know what's going to be historically important. There's the butterfly effect where one little thing here could change the world for someone else. So I was thinking about that a lot and the struggle that we all feel; how much control do I have over my fate, the country, my community? Do I really believe in a perfect future? Some of us would like to think we're creating a better future, especially if we're in politics or public service. We're trying to take a bad situation and make it better. But how much better can we make it? Are we just pushing a rock up a hill and it's going to come down and crush us again? Do we really believe in a perfect society and the idea that America is a noble experiment and we're still working on it to try and get it right? Can anything really be perfect and does that road lead to these totalitarian regimes? The desire to create a better world is a noble goal and we all have it but it can be taken in scary directions. When you have these totalitarian nations, these communist nations that say they're creating a perfect society when really most of us would say they've done the opposite. Trying to control history, or the lack of control, that's something the book deals with. CNN: How did you handle the idea of time travel in your novel? Mullen: I didn't want to write a book with some guy zipping in and out of various situations; I wanted it to be set in the here and now. I liked the idea of a time traveler not just for the moral dilemma but I think he has a great perspective on how he sees our world now, all the tensions in our society, the issues of race and ethnicity. To him he's coming from many, many generations later. I was influenced by this Time magazine cover story, the face of the future and there was this computer program that melded thousands of faces, many generations later after all the races have mixed, this is what people will look like. If I want to be realistic about the idea of a time traveler coming from the future, he's not going to look like us, he's not going to be a white guy, he's not going to be a black guy, he's going to be kind of this amalgam. In any book, it's not a new idea in a time travel story to have everybody say, wait a minute are you just pulling one over on us, are you crazy, are you a reliable narrator? That was fun to work in. CNN: \"The Revisionists\" includes a lot of great detail about U.S. intelligence agencies. Tell me how you researched all of this? Mullen: As with a lot of fiction, some of it was smoke and mirrors and the rest of it was basically just doing a lot of reading. I wasn't a spy and I don't have any friends who were spies, as far as I know. The book changed a lot; I went in different directions because the more I learned I would find a more believable way to advance the story. I think the initial idea I had wouldn't have worked as well and I don't think it would have made you think, \"Wow, this guy knows what he's talking about.\" I learned as I went and I was able to tell a more realistic story as a result. But I didn't go on any drive-bys with any spies, although that would have been cool. CNN: What's next for you? Mullen: I've actually written a lot of my next book already, it's historical again. I'm from Boston, Rhode Island actually, but I'm a Red Sox fan. It's loosely based on a real story, that I found out about in an offhand mention, about FBI involvement in Boston sports, it's a legacy that dates back to 1945 when the FBI was following a group of communists who wanted to racially integrate baseball. I thought, Wow! What's that story? So it's sort of a spy novel, it's also got a bit of romance, and even comedy. I've got an FBI agent, I've also got a female communist sports writer and I've got a baseball star of the Negro League back from World War II. I said I wasn't going to keep writing in a historical vein but sometimes I see an idea and I think that's just too cool. It's been fun to write.

Video shows one black and four white officers beating and kicking unconscious man ejected from car. The five officers have been fired, Mayor Larry Langford said at a news conference Wednesday. An internal inquiry is continuing. The dashboard-cam footage, which officials believe was shot in January 2008, was aired for reporters Wednesday. It showed the end of a 100-mile-an-hour police chase of a van driven by Anthony Warren, suspected of illegal drug activity. Police had chased the van almost 50 miles, winding from downtown Birmingham to suburban Hoover. The video captured the van knocking down a police officer standing on a roadway, then turning up an interstate highway ramp, where it flipped over and rolled into a ditch. Warren was ejected from the van and stopped moving. The five officers -- one black, four white -- ruthlessly beat the suspect, who is black, the video shows.  Watch the tape that lead to the officers' dismissal » . A police mug shot taken five days after the beating was posted on the Web site of The Birmingham News. It shows a badly bruised man wearing a neck brace. Police Chief A.C. Roper told CNN that the video was brought to his attention in March by the district attorney's office, which stumbled upon the footage as it was preparing for Warren's trial. Warren was charged with attempted murder, but no trial took place because he pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of aggravated assault. He is in prison serving a 20-year sentence. Roper said he was \"shocked\" to learn of the video and that it had been around for so long without his knowledge. In addition to a continuing internal investigation that could lead to disciplining supervisors, he said the Alabama Bureau of Investigation is considering criminal charges against the five officers. Langford said the incident brought back to mind days of segregation and police brutality toward blacks. \"The culture of the past was that police brutality was acceptable,\" Langford said. \"In Birmingham, Alabama, in the present day, it is not acceptable.\" Langford said the five officers showed exceptional restraint in chasing the fleeing suspect and performed in exemplary fashion until the last scene caught on the video. The camera captured 11 seconds of the five officers beating Warren with their fists and batons. \"Those 11 seconds will not be tolerated,\" said Langford, who signed letters of termination for the five officers on Tuesday. \"Over 50 years of combined police experience gone over 11 seconds,\" he said.</td><td>Footage believed to have been shot in January 2008 after 50-mile chase .\n",

A co-worker and I walked into the office break room Wednesday, national Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day, to find a dozen or so foil-wrapped sandwiches beckoning us from the counter. This being Atlanta, home of Chick-fil-A, we recognized them immediately, and a closer look at the puck-sized packages bearing the iconic scribbled red logo confirmed our suspicions -- and deepened our paranoia. \"Is this a trick?\" my co-worker asked as he stood frozen in front of the counter. \"Will someone judge me if they see me eating one?\" We had no idea where they had come from and still don't, but our break room is often the dumping ground of leftovers from business meetings where food is served. I also froze in silence because I knew that the answer was yes, some would judge him, at least for the time being, while the company's stance on same-sex marriage is in the spotlight, sparking impassioned op-eds and fiery debate on cable news networks and Facebook Walls across the country. Supporters on both sides of the debate have staged demonstrations, starting with Wednesday's appreciation day and Friday's same-sex \"kiss day\" at Chick-fil-A restaurants across the country. Are you going to \"kiss day\" at Chick-fil-A? Share your story with CNN iReport . Ever since Truett Cathy opened the first Chick-fil-A Restaurant at a mall in suburban Atlanta in 1967, the company has made no secret of its dedication to Christian values. Its corporate purpose is to \"glorify God by being a faithful steward of all that is entrusted to us\" and \"to have a positive influence on all who come in contact with Chick-fil-A.\" All of its locations are closed on Sunday. Chick-fil-A controversy shines light on company's charitable giving . Within this context, many Americans -- including residents of Atlanta, the ninth \"gayest\" American city in 2012, according The Advocate magazine -- have chosen either to enjoy Chick-fil-A's sandwich variations or to not patronize the restaurant because of its values. Or, you might be like one of my gay friends, who would ask others to stand in line for his Chick-fil-A lunch, lest his boyfriend find out. But for many, COO Dan Cathy's recent comment that he supports the \"biblical definition of the family unit\" has forced their hands, compelling them to publicly choose a side and politicize their eating habits. Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day was proposed by former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee in an effort to show support for the company's viewpoint. Those who chose to support Chick-fil-A on Wednesday led to record-breaking sales, the company said, though it did not provide specific sales numbers. \"Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day was not a company promotion; it was initiated by others,\" said Steve Robinson, executive vice president for marketing, in a statement Thursday. \"The Chick-fil-A culture and service tradition in our restaurants is to treat every person with honor, dignity and respect, regardless of their belief, race, creed, sexual orientation or gender.\" Time will tell whether Chick-fil-A suffers any actual fallout from the controversy or if it's just another \"media-driven controversy,\" as some have suggested. After all, Ben & Jerry's is still going strong despite coming out in support of same-sex marriage with flavors like Apple-y Ever After and Chubby Hubby. Californians still swear by In-N-Out Burger regardless of whether their burger comes with a large drink and a citation from a Bible passage. In the meantime, both sides have fanned the flames with high-profile demonstrations and heated rhetoric. Others are left somewhere in the middle, still craving an original chicken sandwich but reluctant to subject themselves to the scrutiny of friends and colleagues, like my co-worker. Heather Roberts of Sugar Land, Texas, made a point of patronizing at Chick-fil-A on Wednesday while visiting Atlanta for a conference. \"We wanted to eat here today, especially to show support not just for Christian values but for his right to express his beliefs,\" Roberts said shortly after finishing a chicken sandwich and waffle fries from a Chick-fil-A stand in the CNN Center food court. She said she shared Cathy's position on same-sex marriage, acknowledging that if the controversy centered around his support for it, she wouldn't have participated in appreciation day. Normally, though, she eats at her local Chick-fil-A at least once a week because she appreciates the food and the customer service -- not because of its Christian values. \"I'm allowed to eat where I want,\" she said. \"We need to be appreciative that we live in a country where we can say what we want and eat where we want.\" Even some people who oppose Cathy's views didn't feel the need to boycott the restaurant, especially if those views don't lead to discrimination against customers or employees. \"I don't agree with the owners' beliefs, but they publicly state that they will serve all who enter the door,\" CNN commenter Doug Barger said. \"I believe in religious freedom,\" the Greenwood, Ohio, resident wrote in an e-mail. \"Because the owner's personal opinions differ from mine points to a healthy society.\" For many, Cathy's views are secondary to his right express them, even among members of the LGBT community. \"Mr. Cathy has been unfairly attacked for his statement that he doesn't support same-sex marriage,\" said Matt Zieminski, a 20-year-old iReporter from California. \"As a gay man, I say, let him not support gays. When the gay community and gay activist groups push on anti-gay people and organizations to change their minds and opinions via bullying or forced involvement, I fear it would make whatever accomplishments taste cheap like a greasy coin. Ultimately, the acceptance of the gay community and the right of gays to marry will not be achieved through violent means, physical and verbal, but through peaceful and honest negotiations.\" How the Chick-fil-A same-sex marriage controversy has evolved . Predictably, Cathy's stance on same-sex marriage kept others away Wednesday. \"I think the (COO) has made eating at Chick-fil-A a political statement. I wouldn't (have) had a problem eating there before, but now that the restaurant has turned into a campaign to bash the rights of the LGBT community, I realize I can put my money somewhere else,\" CNN commenter Wade Pierson said. \"As a born-again gay Christian, it saddens me to see Christians feeding into politics. Politics just divides people and stirs up a lot of anger.\" As counterprotests in the form of \"kiss-ins\" take shape Friday, some would just as soon stay away from Chick-fil-A this week to avoid making the act of eating chicken political. \"Both sides have very good points, but both sides are also wrong, and they're both making this into something far bigger than it needs to be,\" said an Atlanta-based CNN commenter who preferred not to be named. \"Both sides just quite honestly need to grow up and stop acting like 2-year-olds just because somebody said something they didn't like.\" The Atlanta resident says she does not plan to boycott the chain altogether because she agrees with both sides. And she likes the food. Plus, if you start boycotting Chick-fil-A because you disagree with the COO's views, how far will you take your principles? \"I'm very impressed with people that try to avoid right-wing companies from profiting off of them. Trying to avoid Koch products would be really hard. I mean, they even make asphalt!\" a friend said in response to my Facebook question, \"are you conflicted over buying Chick-fil-A?\" \"It's not a political issue for me. I think it's more of a way for people to define themselves in front of their friends,\" she said. \"It reminds me a lot of KONY, people getting riled up over something as a way to define themselves.\" As for my co-worker, he quickly gobbled down his sandwich in the break room while we speculated over where they might have come from. He finished it before others entered the room, tsking as they pulled out their smartphones to take pictures. Two hours later, the rest of the sandwiches were gone.

The 26-year-old Uruguayan international has bagged a league-leading 17 goals in 11 EPL starts this season to lead Liverpool's title challenge. Suarez was the subject of two bids in the last transfer window from Arsenal, who currently top the standings, two points clear of second-placed Liverpool. But after his superb start to the current campaign he has chosen to extend his current contract, which was due to expire in 2016. \"I am delighted to have agreed a new deal with Liverpool and have my future secured for the long term,\" Suarez told Liverpool's official website. \"We have some great players and the team is growing and improving all the time. I believe I can achieve the ambitions of winning trophies and playing at the very highest level with Liverpool. My aim is to help get us there as quickly as possible,\" he added. Manager Brendan Rodgers was naturally delighted to persuade Suarez to sign on the dotted line, with the striker integral to his plans for the club. \"Luis is a world-class talent and securing his services is crucial for what we are trying to achieve here,\" he said. \"What's most important and most exciting is that, at just 26 years old, his best years are still ahead of him and we now know we'll be seeing him reach that potential in a Liverpool shirt.\" Suarez was signed by then Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish from Ajax Amsterdam in January 2011 and immediately impressed observers. But his time on Merseyside has also been marked by two highly controversial incidents, resulting in lengthy bans. He was found guilty by the English Football Association (FA) of racially abusing Manchester United defender Patrice Evra at a match in October 2011 and given an eight-game suspension. At the end of last season, Suarez appeared to bite Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic in an EPL game at Anfield and was banned for 10 games by the FA for violent conduct. With Suarez set to miss out on the start of the new EPL campaign and reportedly wanting to leave Liverpool, Arsenal tabled a record bid of Â£40 million ($65.38 million) plus Â£1 bid, designed to invoke the exit clause in his contract. It was rejected by Liverpool, who proceeded to make a strong start to the season, boosted by the eventual return of Suarez in late September after his ban. He has acquired hero status with the Liverpool fans -- desperate for success after seeing arch-rivals Manchester United take over as the most successful club in English football. Suarez said their support had \"influenced his decision.\" Suarez, who is expected to star for Uruguay in next year's World Cup where they will meet England in the group stages, added: \"We have a special relationship; they have love for me and in return I love them back.\"</td><td>Luis Suarez signs new deal at English Premier League Liverpool .\n",

The Turkish Airlines passenger jet was en route from Turkey to Russia when the incident took place. The plane landed safely and on time Wednesday afternoon in St. Petersburg. Russian authorities promptly arrested a \"slightly intoxicated\" passenger from Uzbekistan, Russia's Interfax News Agency reported, citing a national police spokesman. The suspect, in his early 50s, was arrested on suspicion of trying to hijack the plane, Interfax reported. Turkish media initially reported that the plane had been hijacked. When asked about those reports, a Turkish Airlines spokesman said the flight experienced an \"urgent situation\" as it headed to St. Petersburg, without offering further details. Interfax said the flight was carrying 164 Russian nationals. There have been several attempts to hijack Turkish airlines in recent years. In August 2007, two men hijacked an Istanbul-bound Atlasjet Airlines flight with 136 passengers and crew on board from Cyprus, claiming to have a bomb on board the flight. They forced the crew to make an emergency landing in Antalya. Both hijackers eventually surrendered to Turkish authorities. In April 2007, Turkish authorities detained a man they believed tried to hijack a Turkish airliner, possibly to Iran. The suspect, Mehmed Goksin Gol, was not armed and all 178 passengers and crew aboard the Pegasus Airlines flight were unharmed. The flight was heading from southeastern Turkish city of Diyarbakir to Istanbul, but landed at Ankara's airport, where the suspect was detained. In October 2006, a Turkish man hijacked a Turkish jetliner with 113 people aboard en route from the Albanian capital Tirana for Istanbul. He forced it to fly to a military airfield in Brindisi, Italy, where the passengers and crew were released unharmed.

The passage, which Iran said was part of a training mission, is \"something which has not happened in many years,\" Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman said. \"This is a provocation that proves that the self-confidence and insolence of the Iranians is growing from day to day,\" he said. \"This happens after the Iranian president's visit to south Lebanon and his aggressive declarations there towards Israel.\" The Israeli Defense Ministry said Israel was monitoring the movement of the Iranian ships and alerted its allies. Crude oil for delivery in March rose as much as 1.2% to $85.95 a barrel, following the news. Brent crude, which is traded primarily overseas in Europe, rose as much as 2.1% to $103.31 a barrel. Traders urged caution, saying the reports were still vague. \"The reports are sketchy at the moment, but the news of Iranian warships in the Suez did rally the market a bit,\" said Andrew Lebow, a commodities broker with MF Global. \"The market is looking for more information but certainly we're seeing some short covering on the reports.\" The Suez Canal serves as a key passageway for international trade, allowing ships to navigate between Europe and Asia without having to go all the way around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. Millions of barrels of oil move through the Suez every day on the way to both Europe and North America. Iranian Navy officials have said the flotilla has embarked on a yearlong training mission that takes it to the Gulf of Aden to the Red Sea and through the Suez Canal into the Mediterranean Sea, according to the semi-official Fars News Agency. During the mission, Iranian Navy cadets are due to be trained and prepared for defending the country's cargo ships and oil tankers. Iranian Navy Cmdr. Rear Adm. Habibollah Sayyari said cadets would be trained to protect ships and tankers now under threat of attack from Somali pirates, Fars said. Part of the mission was also to gather intelligence. Sayyari said the ships were in the region in \"pursuit of a powerful (military) presence in the high seas and to consolidate our friendly ties and declare our message of peace and friendship to the regional countries.\" Liberman urged Israel's allies to pay attention. \"We expect the international community to act speedily with determination against the Iranian provocations, designed to deteriorate the situation in the area, and put the Iranians in their place,\" he said. Liberman's comments were not so much a threat but a wake-up call about a \"worrying development,\" said a senior government official who was not identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media. The official said Liberman was \"painting it as a challenge to the West.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamim Netanyahu's office offered no immediate comment.

In a topsy-turvy match, which saw two penalties missed in a frantic second-half, Didier Drogba's superb long-range free-kick eventually proved the difference, as both sides wasted a host of chances to find the net. In a strange twist of fate, the final was played between the last two winners of the competition -- Portsmouth (2008) and Chelsea (2009) -- but the similarity between the two sides ended there. Chelsea had sealed the Premier League title with an 8-0 thrashing of Wigan last weekend, while Portsmouth had suffered a dreadful season in which they became the first Premier League club to enter administration after accumulating huge debts -- subsequently finishing bottom of the table and suffering relegation to the second tier Championship. And that gulf in class between the sides showed in the opening 45 minutes, with Chelsea remarkably hitting the woodwork five times as they peppered the Portsmouth goal. The most glaring miss came from Ivory Coast striker Salomon Kalou, who somehow contrived to hit the crossbar with an open goal gaping, after being superbly set-up by left-back Ashley Cole. Frank Lampard's dipping long-range strike and John Terry's looping header also struck the woodwork, while Drogba gave notice of what was to come in the second half with a stunning free-kick, which England goalkeeper David James somehow managed to get a fingertip to, with the ball bouncing onto the goalline and away. Portsmouth themselves had a great opportunity in the first half, when Frederic Piquionne diverted a cross goalbound, only for goalkeeper Petr Cech to instinctively scramble the ball clear. Underdogs Portsmouth began the second half with more purpose and should have taken a surprise lead. Aruna Dindane out-paced substitute Julian Belletti, who had come on for the injured Michael Ballack, and was fouled by the Brazilian in the penalty area. However, Kevin-Prince Boateng's weak spot-kick was hit straight down the middle, allowing Cech to save with his legs. And Portsmouth were made to play for that miss just two minutes later when Drogba found a gap in the Portsmouth wall to fire his free-kick into the far corner of James' net. Chelsea squandered further chances to double their lead, most notably when Frank Lampard missed the game's second penalty four minutes from the end after Lampard himself had been fouled by Michael Brown. However, Portsmouth failed to trouble Cech's goal after that, although substitute Nadir Belhadj produced a couple of dangerous crosses from the left that caused panic in the Chelsea defence. After the game, Chelsea captain John Terry paid tribute to his side, who join Tottenham (1961), Liverpool (1986), Arsenal (1971, 1998, 2002) and Manchester United (1994, 1996 and 1999) as modern-day \"Double\" winners. \"This is an unbelievable feeling and to win the Double with this group of players is just fantastic,\" Terry told ITV Sport. \"I thought our luck was running out with all those misses but it was a great strike from Didier and I thought we were worthy winners. \"The pitch was awful, the worse pitch we have played on this season, but we played our football and managed to get the victory.\" The result was also a personal triumph for manager Carlo Ancelotti, who managed to achieve what no other Chelsea manager -- including Jose Mourinho -- had achieved by winning the \"Double\" in his first season in charge at Stamford Bridge.</td><td>Chelsea complete a league and FA Cup double after beating Portsmouth 1-0 at Wembley .\n",

Cameron held talks with Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa while in the capital of Colombo for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting on Friday. The summit opened Friday amid concerns about the rights situation after Sri Lanka's war with the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, which ended in 2009. The prime ministers of Canada, Mauritius and India opted not to attend. On Saturday, Cameron acknowledged that Sri Lanka had suffered \"almost three decades of bloody conflict\" and that recovery and reconciliation took time. He said he made it clear to Rajapaksa that he had \"a real opportunity, through magnanimity and reform, to build a successful, inclusive and prosperous future for his country.\" Among the steps needed to achieve this were \"credible, transparent and independent investigations into alleged war crimes,\" Cameron said. \"And let me be very clear. If that investigation is not completed by March, then I will use our position on the U.N. Human Rights Council to work with the U.N. Human Rights Commissioner and call for a full, credible and independent international inquiry.\" Cameron said his meeting with the president was \"very frank\" and \"nothing was off the agenda.\" Read more: Cameron mobbed by protesters in Sri Lanka . A statement issued by Rajapaksa's office earlier Saturday, noted that Cameron had raised concerns \"relating to displaced persons, land issues, military presence in the Province and devolving powers to the newly elected Council.\" \"President Rajapaksa, in response, explained that an enormous amount of work has been done in terms of resettlement, rehabilitation and reconstruction of infrastructure destroyed during the conflict. In order to reach consensus on political matters a Parliamentary Special Committee (PSC) has been established for all parties concerned to air their views and reach a settlement,\" it said. Read more: Sri Lankan diplomat says rights criticism 'proxy propaganda war' The statement said Rajapaksa had observed that the PSC was the best forum for the purpose, stating: \"As it is now only four years since the end of the conflict the country needs some more time to overcome all major challenges.\" In an interview that aired Thursday on CNN's \"Amanpour,\" Sri Lanka's high commissioner to the United Kingdom, Chris Nonis, also denied that an independent international inquiry was needed. \"We respect the independence and sovereignty of your country, and we expect you to respect ours. We don't need an international investigation when we have had a vibrant civilization for 2,500 years. We have perfectly educated people, and I think we're perfectly capable of carrying out our own domestic inquiry,\" he told CNN's Frederik Pleitgen. Nonis pointed to the 2011 \"Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission\" report, which Rajapaksa ordered. \"It's a very holistic, very comprehensive, very impartial report. It had over 5,000 hearings, and it's set within the principle of international humanitarian law, incorporating the principle of distinction and the principle of proportionality.\" Independent judiciary? As many as 70,000 people were killed in Sri Lanka's war. In its final stage, which lasted from September 2008 to May 2009, the Sri Lankan army advanced into an area of the north where about 330,000 people were trapped by fighting. A U.N. report in 2011 said the government used \"large-scale and widespread shelling\" that left a large number of civilians dead. The number of civilian deaths and injuries are unknown to this day, and U.N. figures greatly differ from those in reports from Sri Lanka's government and various nongovernmental organizations. The International Bar Association's Human Rights Institute on Friday questioned whether Sri Lanka's legal system was capable of responding to human rights violations, saying that required an independent judiciary. \"Since the end of the armed conflict, the Sri Lankan government has been systematically dismantling checks and balances on independent justice institutions,\" co-chair Helena Kennedy said in a statement. \"The IBAHRI considers that the lack of an independent judiciary will prevent the Sri Lankan legal system from providing an effective investigation into war crimes and human rights violations committed by government forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam at the end of the armed conflict in 2009.\" The Commonwealth is a voluntary association of 53 nations that initially formed out of what had been the British Empire.

He said six of them were in satisfactory condition and another was still being evaluated. The incident began when fumes from the de-icing application got into the cabin of Alaska Airlines Flight 528.  Watch an ex-transportation official explain how the fumes seeped into the plane » . Alaska Airlines said the flight was getting ready for takeoff to Burbank, California, when passengers began to complain of eye irritation and strong fumes from the chemicals. Video footage showed several emergency vehicles around the plane on the snow-covered tarmac. The airline said the plane, a Boeing 737-800, was carrying 143 passengers and several crew members. Boren called the situation \"very unusual\" and said maintenance crew had been working on the plane. Cooper said the airline was bringing in another aircraft to transport the passengers to their destination. Seattle has been blanketed with nearly 9 inches of snow this week, and forecasters predicted snow mixed with rain Wednesday, with an accumulation of about a half inch of new snow through Thursday. One passenger, Joe Dial of Seattle, told CNN affiliate KIRO-TV that passengers were exposed to the de-icer fumes for 45 minutes before they were able to leave the plane. The jetliner had pulled away from the gate Wednesday morning, but then had to return for the de-icing process, Dial told KIRO. Meanwhile in Moline, Illinois, an AirTran Airways jet skidded off the runway at Quad City International Airport, CNN affiliate WQAD-TV reported. Witnesses said passengers were being evacuated to buses, and there appeared to be no injuries, according to WQAD. The airport was closed to all traffic after the accident, the station said. At airports elsewhere across the U.S., weather was forcing significant delays as travelers tried to reach their destinations by Christmas. Flights bound for Newark-Liberty International Airport in New Jersey faced delays averaging three hours. Flights into Chicago's O'Hare International Airport in Illinois, John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and San Francisco International Airport in California were all subject to delays averaging an hour or more, according to the FAA. Travelers at O'Hare were hoping Wednesday went better than the day before as thousands were stranded in the nation's second-busiest airport overnight when hundreds of flights were canceled. \"It is ruining my holiday,\" one stranded passenger, Keith Bouchard, told CNN affiliate WLS-TV. \"I am not going to have a holiday mood till I get home,\" stranded passenger Ken Estes told WLS. O'Hare's trouble extended to South Florida, where Laura Weichhand and Rachel Lewis got stuck at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport when their flight to Chicago was canceled. \"If we want to be home for Christmas ... our only option is we're going to drive 26 hours to be home for Christmas,\" Lewis told CNN affiliate WPLG-TV. The Chicago area was expected to get 1 inch to 3 inches of new snow Wednesday. At Colorado's Denver International Airport, lost luggage was a huge problem. Thousands of pieces of unclaimed baggage were in the airport's arrivals area, CNN affiliate KMGH-TV reported. Deanna Nokes, who was stranded in Denver on her way to Portland, Oregon, told KGMH her bags were nowhere in sight. \"They don't even know where my bag is,\" she told the station. \"It still could be in Vegas, or Phoenix, or Portland.\" Airports in Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington, were hit hardest by weather delays earlier in the week, with hundreds of flight cancellations Sunday through Tuesday. The two Northwest airports were reporting just a few delays Wednesday, but a new storm was rolling in from the Pacific Ocean, bringing snow and rain, the National Weather Service said. \"It will not be as strong as this past weekend's storm,\" said weather service meteorologist Kirby Cook in Seattle. But that may be of little consolation to thousands of travelers stranded at Northwest airports because of cancellations earlier in the week. Alaska Airlines, the area's major carrier, said fully booked holiday flights left it with few options to accommodate the weather weary, CNN affiliate KHQ-TV in Spokane, Washington, reported. Some in Spokane turned to Craigslist.com to try to get home for Christmas. The Web site had more than 30 posts from people looking to get to or out of Spokane, CNN affiliate KXLY-TV reported. \"I know Craigslist has a rideshare community so I thought I'd try, and so far not so good,\" Priscilla Davis of Federal Way, Washington, told KXLY.</td><td>NEW: 18 passengers treated at scene after exposure to de-icing fluid .\n",

The people have to understand that.\" CNN Soundwaves: Big Boi on Big Boi . Talking about life . According to Big Boi the average person is living an illusion and accepting false information. Hence the name of his latest solo album (he counts it as his third, calling \"Speakerboxxx\" his actual first album), \"Vicious Lies and Dangerous Rumors,\" which he has called an overall \"search for truth.\" Released via Def Jam, \"VLADR\" is a follow-up to Big Boi's 2010 release, \"Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty,\" and comes from a title his grandmother had for her (planned?) autobiography in which she would air the family's dirty laundry. Big Boi's latest musical effort is his way of exposing himself and the world around him. \"I'm talking about life,\" he said of the 14-track disc (17 if you nabbed the deluxe version). \"Some people don't get that because they're so numb to what the mainstream media is pumping into their head with these reality shows and a certain type of song that's played 1,000 times on the radio every day and I refuse to do that.\" So what did he do? If you were to ask the music critics, Big Boi just released his most complete work to date and the closest fans will get (for now) to an OutKast album in terms of it's boldness in sound and creative risks. But before Big Boi could ever move forward carving out his legacy, he had to shake an old stigma from his past. 'The player and the poet' Shortly after the success of their first hit single, \"Player's Ball\" in 1993, Big Boi and his partner-in-rhyme Andre 3000 were dubbed \"the player and the poet,\" with Patton playing the role of the former. Through marketing and promotion, Big Boi was cast as the bad boy, while Andre was the thoughtful, creative one. Big Boi maintains that he has never liked the moniker. \"Everybody thought I was just a DBoy. I'm just selling dope and getting laid all day,\" he said. \"I think when they put that title on it people kind of took it and ran with it.\" OutKast went on to sell more than 20 million records, earning multiple Grammys, including album of the year in 2004, and the group has since been hailed as creative geniuses and one of the greatest hip-hop groups of all time. Search for truth . While \"VLADR\" has a lot of George Clinton-style funk and features indie rockers Phantogram and Little Dragon, it also carries the political punch of Public Enemy, with songs like \"Shoes for Running,\" which some might say borders on conspiracy theory. One of the track's opening lines is: \"I wish they could send me to the moon and back with a cure for cancer and save the lives of my great grandmomma and great granddaddy now that's the answer to the question/ but they make money off the medicine leaving us all stuck in elections with no progressions just recessions.\" And so back to that whole \"truther\" thing, which Big Boi said is just his taking the time to find information and share it with anyone who will listen. He is also quick to strike down the conspiracy theorist label. \"I mean its drone strikes, United States killing kids overseas every day, they're not telling you about that,\" he said. \"Why not? Are our kids' lives more valuable than the ones' overseas? A child is a child. These are facts. There's no conspiracy in this.\" Best friends . Another theory Big Boi finds himself dealing with is the status of OutKast and his relationship with Andre 3000. There was the whole Gillette \"diss\" and the apology Andre 3000 made to Big Boi via T.I.'s \"I'm Sorry.\" Or could it just be the fact that since, really, 2000's \"Stankonia,\" the duo has more or less not made an album together? If you listen carefully, Big Boi addresses the matter on \"VLADR,\" but he doesn't hold back if asked about it, either. \"People don't know or they don't catch all of the interviews and then (there's) all the sensational headlines, but you've got to really understand that me and Dre have a relationship that's bigger than music,\" he said. \"We're best friends. Music just came along because it's what we're put here to do and what God brought us together to do. But that's my brother; you know what I'm saying? There's no beef, no nothing.\" In fact, not one song made it to the final cut of \"VLADR\" without a listen from Andre 3000, Big Boi said. Verbal exercises . Fans and the Internet were abuzz when word got out Big Boi and Dre would be \"reuniting\" for Frank Ocean's \"Pink Matter,\" and T.I.'s I'm Sorry,\" both tracks that already featured Andre 3000. In a text message, Big Boi responded to the idea of these songs being OutKast reunions. \"They aren't,\" he wrote. \"I'm just verbally exercising.\" To the folks calling for a new OutKast album, Big's answer is, well, honest. \"If we did records like what I'm doing right now, if I go so deep y'all will never get an OutKast album,\" he said. \"We ain't excited about doing an OutKast album because people ain't going to understand it.\"</td><td>Rapper Big Boi says his latest album is a \"search for truth\"\n",

Their dexterous fingers race up and down large wooden looms, weaving the bold geometric patterns distinct to Pirot carpets. Once celebrated throughout Europe for their beauty, Pirot carpets graced the walls and floors of Serbian royal palaces, as well homes of the urban elite. Weaved for over four centuries in the town after which they were named -- Pirot, once a thriving trade center on the caravan route between east and west -- they were ceremonially rolled out for state visits, and given to foreign dignitaries. However, what was a thriving craft practiced by 5,000 weavers a century ago is now under threat of extinction, with only 10 women still keeping the tradition going. \"Pirot carpet weaving is our treasure which is passed on from generation to generation. It's the knowledge I learned from my mother and my grandmother,\" says Slavica Ciric who founded the Lady's Heart cooperative in Pirot with local women in 2009, to try to stop the skills nurtured throughout centuries from passing into oblivion. \"Carpet weaving is in our DNA,\" she continues. \"We were born on carpets and we grew up in houses filled with Pirot carpets.\" Mastery of craft . Pirot carpets are very thin but extremely dense, and are said to last more than a century. They have two identical sides and are geographically protected, which means that they can only be made in the Pirot area, and out of Pirot sheep -- a rare breed with only a few flocks counting just 250 sheep remaining. Weaving is painstaking work. It requires geometrical precision, supreme skill and creativity in equal measure. Everything is done by hand only, and in the same way as hundreds of years ago. It takes two weavers working simultaneously a month to create less than one square meter. Traditionally a female activity, young girls would start at the loom at the age of 10, practicing every day for five years to reach a level considered good enough. Their weaving skill had a great impact on their marriage prospects -- it was considered a measure of intelligence because of the knowledge of mathematics required to calculate the size and distribution of patterns. \"When you look at a carpet with an untrained eye, you can see beautiful colorful patterns, but we work out exactly how many of these patterns we can fit within a meter,\" says Ciric. \"We have to be visionaries and use logic to see where these patterns will stop, and where the border of the carpet will connect and finish,\" she adds. And if a weaver makes a mistake, the carpet is instantly pulled apart, even if the work was nearly completed. Magical meaning . The concentration necessary for this kind of precise work often means that once a weaver sits down at the loom, she loses all sense of time. \"The pattern in a mysterious way simply possesses her, drags her into the depth and she's so taken by her work that everything around her stops. She forgets about the time, she surrenders herself to the pattern,\" says Ciric. And it's those patterns that give Pirot carpets a mystical allure. Weavers say they represent ancient symbols which carry magical meanings and can be read as an image alphabet, and there are 95 varieties which weavers have to memorize. \"It is very mysterious but in every single carpet there is a story which you can read. When I see a carpet I can immediately tell whether it has been made now or in a different period, whether it has been made with love or only to be sold,\" says Ciric. Even though this skill is now practiced only by a handful of women, Ciric and her fellow weavers from Lady's Heart are trying to pass it on to the next generation, organizing winter courses for schoolchildren, including boys. \"There is a new generation coming along and if we manage to pass on this knowledge to them, I think there won't be any danger of this craft dying out,\" says Ciric. \"We are the guardians of the tradition of Pirot carpet weaving, and we do this with love.\" Read this: Resilient Belgrade rebuilds once again .

His friends said it was too dangerous. But in 2011 veteran American football coach Dan Gaspar ignored the warnings and traveled to the Islamic Republic of Iran -- Washington's longtime political nemesis -- to help Iran's national football team qualify for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. \"Sports is my life,\" said Gaspar. \"When I came to Iran it didn't have anything to do with political reasons. My personality is one of adventure and curiosity. I wanted to experience a culture in a part of the world I had never been to.\" The goalkeeping coach's journey to Iran is the latest chapter in an international career that's taken the 58-year-old from the amateur football leagues in the U.S. state of Connecticut -- where he was born -- to the football capitals of the world. The Portuguese-American's resume includes stints with Major League Soccer's NY/NJ MetroStars and the Portuguese national team -- featuring megastar Cristiano Ronaldo -- which qualified for the 2010 World Cup. In 2011, Gaspar's friend and former colleague Carlos Queiroz was named head of coach of Iran's national football team. Soon after, Queiroz invited Gaspar to join the coaching staff in Iran. At the time, the Iranian government was locked in a bitter political feud with Washington. Iran regularly called the U.S. \"The Great Satan\". U.S. politicians frequently described Iran as a rogue nation led by a radical regime, secretly building a nuclear bomb. When discussing Washington's conflict with Tehran, U.S. President Barack Obama said that \"all options are on the table\", suggesting an attack against Iran was not out of the question. Despite the ominous climate Gaspar accepted the offer -- a decision his wife wasn't quite comfortable with. \"She was shocked,\" Gaspar said. \"She was concerned as most family members were.\" Gaspar admits he had concerns too. \"When we first arrived, we didn't know how to behave and how to react,\" he said. During his first few months Gaspar didn't socialize much and rarely left his apartment, except for trips to football practice. But Gaspar says he steadily started feeling comfortable. He says he learned his impressions of Iran, created mostly by the media, didn't quite match reality. \"When you listen to the news and you read the news, you see things. Sometimes during commercials I step off my couch and look out of the balcony and it's not what I am seeing, it's not what I am reading, it's not what I am hearing.\" Gaspar says what he has observed during his stay in Iran is a nation full of generous people who love their country, their food and their football team. One of his most memorable moments was meeting former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. \"He walked on to the pitch and asked everyone to sit down, and then he himself sat down on the grass,\" Gaspar said. \"I thought it was interesting how he put himself on the same level as everyone else. At the end of the day -- I saw him as another human being.\" In recent months, Gaspar's stay in Iran has coincided with a push by Tehran to improve relations with Washington, as moderate President Hassan Rouhani tries to settle Iran's nuclear dispute with the west. \"Right now more than ever there seems to be a lot of hope and optimism and a sense of energy that things will get better,\" says Gaspar. \"For me I believe in peace, and, if peace is an end result, then that's best for the world.\" But the highlight of Gaspar's Iranian adventure came on the night of June 18, when Iran's national football team recorded a 1-0 win over South Korea to qualify for the World Cup for only the fourth time. The win sparked frenzied celebrations on the field and in the streets of Tehran. \"There were a lot of tears, a lot of hugging. You can't describe it. Only a few privileged people have the opportunity to climb the mountain and go to the big dance in Brazil in 2014.\" Gaspar says his only disappointment that night was not being able to share the win with his wife and family back in America. His contract in Iran runs through World Cup in Brazil next June and July. He says his focus is to help Iran impress at the tournament and then return to America with some remarkable memories. \"If I would've listened to the experts, and my friends, and family, I would have never been here in Iran. It's been part of my life for three years and the memories will last a lifetime.\"</td><td>American Dan Gaspar is part of the coaching team for the Iran football team .\n",

Eto'o added his second when converting a lofted pass from Lucio and completed his treble nine minutes from time when out-pacing the Werder defence after latching onto Wes Sneijder's pass, and rounding Wiese. And Eto'o also had a hand in the goal that put Inter 3-0 ahead, with his pinpoint pass finding Sneijder -- and the Dutchman fired into the top corner.

Van der Vaart wasted a chance to put the hosts ahead when goalkeeper Nikolay Mihaylov saved his spot-kick after Peter Wisgerhof fouled Peter Crouch in the area. But Van der Vaart made amends soon after the break when converting on the turn a Crouch knock-down. Spurs soon made it 2-0 when Roman Pavlyuchenko scored from the penalty spot after a foul on Gareth Bale. Twente pulled a goal back through substitute Nacer Chadli before van der Vaart was given his marching orders for lunging in on Roberto Rosales. But Tottenham restored their two-goal advantage when Pavlyuchenko netted another spot-kick after a handball in the area and Bale added a late fourth to put the icing on the cake.

Reliable numbers were difficult to come by. CNN bases its figures on reports from witnesses. Amnesty International, citing local human rights activists, reported that at least 75 people were killed in Friday's protests. The Syrian government does not permit CNN to report from inside the country. The killings occurred in several flashpoint regions as thousands of Syrian protesters defiantly marched after Muslims' weekly prayers in a display of mass discontent toward the government. Violence ripped through the Damascus suburbs of Douma, Moademy, and Zamalka, and other cities -- Homs, Harasta, and Izraa. The state-run news agency reported demonstrations and clashes, citing injuries but no deaths. Human rights groups and witnesses told a different story. \"Today, they have killed so many people. There are so many people injured and people have been kidnapped,\" Wissam Tarif, a human rights activist, told CNN. \"They are acting as an armed gang, not as security forces.\" The violence prompted international condemnation, with British Foreign Secretary William Hague calling the killings \"unacceptable,\" and calling on Syrian security forces \"to exercise restraint instead of repression, and on the Syrian authorities to respect the Syrian people's right to peaceful protest.\" Before Friday's marches, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said the death toll had exceeded 200 since the demonstrations began in mid-March. Human rights groups had been urging the government to refrain from cracking down on peaceful turnouts during the Facebook-inspired outpouring dubbed \"Great Friday.\" A witness in Douma said eight people died and approximately 25 were wounded when security forces fired on several thousand protesters. Riot police and secret police comprised the security forces and a sniper on a hospital roof was seen taking shots at people. Pellets and lethal rounds were used, the witness said, as people chanted for the downfall of the regime. A doctor in the Damascus suburb of Moadamy said six people were killed and dozens wounded when security forces fired in an \"indiscriminate and disproportionate manner\" on thousands of demonstrators. The doctor, a pediatrician, said it was difficult taking the wounded to the hospital. Syrian security forces had set up checkpoints across the area and were preventing anyone from entering or leaving the suburb. Five people were killed in the Damascus suburb of Zamalka, a witness said. An opposition leader in Homs said 12 people died and dozens were wounded when security forces fired on demonstrators. Protesters raced from the main streets for cover in smaller streets and alleys where they waited for the situation to calm. A witness said one of the dead was a 41-year-old demonstrator who was shot in the neck. Tarif said security forces fired on demonstrators from the southern city of Izraa who were trying to join protesters in nearby Daraa, killing nine and wounding others. Two people in Izraa reported seeing an assault on demonstrators and many casualties. An activist in Harasta in the south said 2,000 to 3,000 people met with a fierce crackdown by security forces, and heavy gunfire could be heard over the phone as the witness spoke. Three people have been killed and nine wounded, the source said. In protest, demonstrators burned down a police station. In Daraa, where the protests got their start last month, people shouted \"dignity and freedom!\" Activist Razan Zaitouneh in Damascus said security forces in the suburb of Sit Zainab fired on demonstrators who were tearing down a statue of Hafez al-Assad, the president's late father and the former ruler of Syria. She said three people were wounded when security forces opened fire in Hasaka in the northeast. Witnesses reported demonstrations in the capital, Damascus, where people chanted slogans and tear gas was fired amid a moderate security presence. Amateur video obtained by CNN purportedly shows demonstrations in Homs, Damascus, Banias, Kiswah, and Qamlishi. CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the material. The Syrian Arab News Agency said a \"limited number of demonstrators\" came out on Friday in the Damascus area, Hama, Deir Ezzour, Hasaka, Daraa, and Banias. It said security forces settled \"scuffles that erupted between demonstrators and citizens\" in Hama, Harasta, al-Hajar al-Aswad, and Hasaka. Demonstrations have been a daily occurrence across Syria for weeks and huge rallies have been common in the authoritarian state after Friday prayers across the predominantly Muslim nation. As people gathered to express their grievances toward the government, they've frequently been greeted with force from police. Friday's turnouts came a day after President Bashar al-Assad lifted the country's 48-year-old state of emergency and abolished the state security court, both of which were key demands of the demonstrators. The emergency law permitted the government to make preventive arrests and override constitutional and penal code statutes. The security court was a special body that prosecuted people regarded as challenging the government. Al-Assad's decrees on Thursday included recognizing and regulating the right to peaceful protest. They also extended the period that security forces can hold suspects in certain crimes. But Human Rights Watch says the decrees don't \"address the extensive immunity that Syrian law provides to members of its security services.\" It urged al-Assad to undertake more change, such as releasing political prisoners and those arrested for participating in peaceful protests, order probes in security force violations, ensure detainees gain \"prompt access to a lawyer,\" and amend repressive provisions of the penal code. It said the government, which is controlled by the Baath Party, should \"enact a political parties' law in compliance with international human rights norms.\" Such a law would allow the establishment of independent political parties. Hague urged the government to address the citizenry's \"legitimate demands.\" \"Political reforms should be brought forward and implemented without delay,\" he said. \"The Emergency Law should be lifted in practice, not just in word.\" Tarif also said that \"lifting the emergency law is a big joke while the security forces have impunity. \"This is going to become worse. Remember, tomorrow are the funerals,\" he said. U.S. President Barack Obama issued a statement in which he condemned \"in the strongest possible terms\" the use of force by the Syrian government against demonstrators. \"This outrageous use of violence to quell protests must come to an end now,\" he said. \"The Syrian people have called for the freedoms that all individuals around the world should enjoy: freedom of expression, association, peaceful assembly, and the ability to freely choose their leaders. President Assad and the Syrian authorities have repeatedly rejected their calls and chosen the path of repression.\" He accused Assad of \"blaming outsiders while seeking Iranian assistance in repressing Syria's citizens through the same brutal tactics that have been used by his Iranian allies.\" Obama added, \"The United States will continue to stand up for democracy and the universal rights that all human beings deserve, in Syria and around the world.\" In separate statements, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the spokesman for France's Ministry of European and Foreign Affairs condemned the violence.

In addition, the number of people living with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, has increased, and over the last five years, AIDS deaths have declined by 10 percent, thanks to antiretroviral drug therapy and access to lifesaving treatments, said the report by the Joint U.N. Program on HIV/AIDS and World Health Organization. However, not all the news was good as researchers found evidence that some prevention programs miss the mark because they are not tailored for different populations affected by the epidemic. Success was seen particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where new infections declined about 15 percent, or some 400,000 people, according to the report. However, that area remains the region hardest-hit by the virus, accounting for 67 percent of infections worldwide, the report said. \"The epidemic continues to have an enormous impact on households, communities, businesses, public services and national economies in the region,\" it said. In 2008, for instance, more than 14.1 million children in sub-Saharan Africa were estimated to have lost one or both parents to AIDS. In East Asia, new infections declined by nearly 25 percent, and by 10 percent in South and Southeast Asia, the organizations said. In Eastern Europe, a region that had seen a dramatic increase in new infections among intravenous drug users, \"the epidemic has leveled off considerably,\" the report said. In Eastern Europe and Central Asia, an HIV epidemic that once resulted from injected drug use is spreading to the sexual partners of those drug users, according to the report. And in some parts of Asia, heterosexual couples are being affected. The prevalence of HIV continues to increase in those regions because of the new infections, the report said. And in Swaziland in southern Africa, more than two-thirds of adult infections occur in people 25 and older, but few programs are aimed at those adults, the report said. While the decline in new infections is welcome, \"if we do a better job of getting resources and programs to where they will make most impact, quicker progress can be made and more lives saved,\" said Michael Sidibe, executive director of UNAIDS in Geneva, Switzerland. There is also an increased evidence of risk among key populations, the report said. For instance, although high prevalence among sex workers has been widely noted, evidence was limited on the prevalence among men engaging in homosexual activity and intravenous drug users. \"In recent years, studies have documented elevated levels of infection in these populations in nearly all regions,\" according to the report. \"In all settings and for diverse types of epidemics, it is clear that programs to prevent new infections among these key populations must constitute an important part of national AIDS responses.\" Also, the level of resources directed at prevention programs for those key groups is \"typically quite low, even in concentrated epidemics,\" according to the report. Another shortage can be seen in the programs that are designed for people living with HIV.</td><td>New infections in sub-Saharan Africa 15 percent lower in 2008, report says .\n",

Setting out from Maerkang in Sichuan Province at 8 p.m. Monday, the 100 or so troops had to travel 200 kilometers (124 miles) to go before reaching Wenchuan, the epicenter of the quake, also in the province, Xinhua reported. After seven hours, they still had 70 kilometers (43 miles) to go. \"I have seen many collapsed civilian houses, and the rocks dropped from mountains on the roadside are everywhere,\" the head of the unit, Li Zaiyuan, told Xinhua. Added CNN Correspondent John Vause: \"The roads here are terrible in the best of times ... right now they're down right atrocious. They've resorted to going in one man at a time on foot.\" Nearly all the confirmed deaths were in Sichuan Province, but rescuers were hindered because roads linking it to the provincial capital, Chengdu, were damaged, Xinhua reported. Local radio quoted disaster relief officials as saying a third of the buildings in Wenchuan collapsed from the quake and another third were seriously damaged. The earthquake was powerful enough to be felt throughout most of China. Many children were buried under the rubble of their schools. The Chinese government said the death toll was sure to rise. An expert told CNN the 7.9-magnitude quake at about 2:28 p.m. Monday (6:28 a.m. GMT) was the largest the region has seen \"for over a generation.\" Residents as far as Chongqing -- about 200 miles from the epicenter in Sichuan Province -- spent the night outdoors, too afraid of aftershocks to sleep indoors. Local radio in Sichuan quoted disaster relief officials as saying a third of the buildings in Wenchuan collapsed from the quake and another third were seriously damaged.  Watch as the death toll rises » . The state-run Zhongxin news agency reported that a survivor who escaped Beichuan county in Sichuan Province described the province as having been \"razed to the ground.\" The Red Cross Society of China, coordinating some of the international aid efforts, encouraged financial donations because of the difficulty of getting supplies to those most in need. At least six schools collapsed to some extent in the quake or aftershocks that followed, Xinhua reported.  See a report on rescue operations at the school » . At one school, almost 900 students -- all eighth-graders and ninth-graders, according to a local villager -- were believed to be buried.  See workers in Chengdu hiding under their desks during the quake » . At least 50 bodies were pulled from the rubble by Monday night at Juyuan Middle School in Juyuan Township of Dujiangyan City, Sichuan Province, Xinhua reported. \"Some buried teenagers were struggling to free themselves from the ruins while others were calling for help. Eight excavators were working at the site. Devastated parents watched as five cranes worked at the site and an ambulance waited,\" Xinhua reported. \"A tearful mother said her son, ninth-grader Zhang Chengwei, was buried in the ruins.\" Meanwhile, 2,300 people were buried in two collapsed chemical plants in Sichuan's Shifang city, and 80 tons of ammonia leaked out, Xinhua reported. Six hundred people died there. The plants were among a series of buildings that collapsed, including private homes, schools and factories. The local government has evacuated 6,000 civilians from the area and was dispatching firefighters to help at the scene, Xinhua reported. Much of the nation's transportation system shut down. Xinhua reported there were \"multiple landslides and collapses along railway lines\" near Chengdu.  Quake victims have been sleeping outside in Chengdu » . Sichuan Province sits in the Sichuan basin and is surrounded by the Himalayas to the west. The Yangtze River flows through the province and the Three Gorges Dam in the nearby Hubei Province controls flooding to the Sichuan -- though there were no reports of damage to the world's largest dam. Monday's quake was caused by the Tibetan plateau colliding with the Sichuan basin, Zhigang Peng, an earthquake expert at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia, told CNN. \"Earthquakes in this part of China are infrequent but not uncommon,\" he said. The last major earthquake in the region occurred in the northwestern margin of the Sichuan basin when a 7.5-magnitude quake killed more than 9,300 people on August 25, 1933. President Hu Jintao ordered an all-out effort to help those affected, and Premier Wen Jiabao traveled to the region to direct the rescue work, Xinhua reported. \"My fellow Chinese, facing such a severe disaster, we need calm, confidence, courage and efficient organization,\" Wen was quoted as saying. \"I believe we can certainly overcome the disaster with the public and the military working together under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the government.\" Peter Sammonds, professor of geophysics at University College London, called the earthquake \"tremendous.\" \"Particularly in the more remote, the more mountainous part where this has taken place, a lot of the buildings are built on sediments that are quite unstable. They're probably liquifying, causing the buildings to collapse. You might expect landslides to occur, which could actually stop the relief efforts going through on the roads, so this could be very grim in the remoter, more mountainous parts of this province.\" While many of the most immediate efforts were focused on Sichuan Province, Xinhua also reported dead and injured in Gansu, Chongqing and Yunnan provinces. A provincial government spokesman said they feared more dead and injured in collapsed houses in Dujiangyan City in Wenchuan County. A driver for the seismological bureau said he saw \"rows of houses collapsed\" in Dujiangyan, Xinhua reported. Bonnie Thie, the country director of the Peace Corps, told CNN she was on a university campus in Chengdu about 60 miles from the epicenter, in the eastern part of China's Sichuan province, when the first quake hit. \"You could see the ground shaking,\" Thie told CNN. The shaking \"went on for what seemed like a very long time,\" she said. Bruce Presgrave, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey, said this quake could cause major damage because of its strength and proximity to major population centers. Also, it was relatively shallow,  and those kinds of quakes tend to do more damage near the epicenter than deeper ones, Presgrave said. An earthquake with 7.5 magnitude in the northern Chinese city of Tangshan killed 255,000 people in 1976 -- the greatest death toll from an earthquake in the last four centuries and the second greatest in recorded history, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Tangshan is roughly 995 miles (1,600 km) from Chengdu, the nearest major city to the epicenter of Monday's quake.  Read an explanation about earthquakes » . After the quake struck Monday, the ground shook as far away as Beijing, which is 950 miles (1,528 km) from the epicenter. Residents of the Chinese capital, which hosts this year's Olympic Games in August, felt a quiet, rolling sensation for about a minute.  See CNN's interview with an American in Chengdu » . Thousands of people were evacuated from Beijing buildings immediately after the earthquake. At least seven more earthquakes -- measuring between 4.0 and 6.0 magnitudes -- happened nearby over the four hours after the initial quake at at 2:28 p.m. local time, the USGS reported. A spokesman for the Beijing Olympic Committee said no Olympic venues were affected. The huge Three Gorges Dam -- roughly 400 miles east of the epicenter -- was not damaged, a spokesman said. The earthquake was also felt in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Taiwan, and as far away as Hanoi, Vietnam, and Bangkok, Thailand, according to the Hong Kong-based Mandarin-language channel Phoenix TV.

         "(CNN) -- Pakistan took big steps towards leveling the two-Test cricket series against Australia after bowling out their opponents for just 88 runs in Britain on Wednesday. The Australians, who won the first match by 150 runs, failed to reach three figures in an innings for the first time since 1984 as captain Ricky Ponting paid for his decision to bat first in bowler-friendly conditions after winning the toss. Pakistan, led by new captain Salman Butt after Shahid Afridi ended his brief return to the Test arena following that defeat at Lord's, then reached 148-3 before rain cut short the opening day in Leeds. Teenage paceman Mohammad Aamer and fellow opening bowler Mohammad Asif took three wickets each as Australia crashed to the nation's lowest first-innings score since 1956 -- when dismissed for 80, also by Pakistan. \"There was moisture under the wicket so I think it was a shocking decision, especially for Australia,\" Pakistan bowler Umar Gul told reporters. \"I don't know what the captain and coach's decision was going to be but if we won the toss we were ready to bowl first. This morning it was swinging a lot and the ball was seaming.\" Tim Paine's leading knock of 17 was Australia's fourth-lowest in a Test innings in which all 11 players have batted. The No. 7 was last man out in a fighting 47-ball stay, scoring one more run than all-rounder Marcus North. Gul also claimed two wickets while Umar Amin dismissed North and was also involved in the run-out of tailender Ben Hilfenhaus. The Pakistanis went into a 13-match losing run against Australia that goes back to 1995, but struck an early blow when the 18-year-old Aamer trapped opener Simon Katich leg before wicket for 13. Afridi quits Tests after 150-run defeat at Lord's . That opened the floodgates as Asif sent Shane Watson (5) and Ponting (6) back to the pavilion at Headingley in similar fashion, and Gul bowled Michael Clarke (3). From 29-4, Australia slumped further to 73-6 at lunch as Mike Hussey (5) also went lbw to Gul and North was caught behind off the medium pace of Amin. Aamer then took wickets with the first two balls of the middle session, bowling Steven Smith and Mitchell Johnson, but Hilfenhaus avoided becoming the hat-trick victim. Australia's bowlers could not extract the same amount of swing from the overcast conditions, and Butt put on 80 for the first wicket with Imran Farhat before being bowled by Hilfenhaus. Farhat also fell short of a half-century as he was trapped lbw by Watson for 45 with the score at 133, and the all-rounder then dispatched Azar Ali (30) seven runs later. Amin (1) and Umar Akmal (8) were unbeaten when bad light and then rain ended a day on which 13 wickets fell for just 236 runs. The series is being played in England due to security issues in Pakistan.",

         "(CNN) -- Federal prosecutors are pushing to force the Arizona man accused of fatally gunning down six people and wounding 13 others, including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, to submit a handwriting sample -- a request that he, thus far, has refused. A motion was filed Monday, out of the office of U.S. Attorney Dennis Burke in Arizona, asking the court to compel Jared Lee Loughner to write out something so authorities can view his writing style. The government wants the sample to compare with handwritten notes found in Loughner's residence that include mentions of Giffords \"as well as references to guns and bullets,\" according to a court document. It says he has resisted such requests to date, \"arguing that the court lacks authority\" to force him to provide a sample. \"There being no other avenue to obtain the defendant's handwriting exemplar, the government now seeks an order to compel,\" prosecutors wrote in the motion. Last Thursday, a federal grand jury returned a new indictment against Loughner in which he is charged on 49 counts -- including murder and attempted murder -- related to the shooting outside a Tucson supermarket in January. The 22-year-old Tucson man was indicted on three counts of attempted murder, including one alleging that he tried to kill Giffords with a Glock semiautomatic handgun during the event she was hosting for constituents. After being shot through the head, the congresswoman is now undergoing rehabilitation at a medical facility in Houston, Texas. The new indictment -- which supersedes an earlier one, which had fewer charges -- adds murder charges connected to the deaths of John M. Roll, a federal district judge, and Gabriel M. Zimmerman, a staff member for Giffords. Loughner also faces charges in the deaths of Dorothy J. Morris, Phyllis C. Schneck, Dorwan C. Stoddard, and a child, referred to in the indictment as C-T G. Nine-year-old Christina-Taylor Green was among those killed in the shooting. Autopsy reports released Monday showed that Zimmerman, Schneck and Stoddard suffered fatal head wounds, while the three others were shot in the chest. Loughner could face a death sentence if convicted, Burke said last week, although prosecutors have not said yet whether they will seek the death penalty. Loughner, who is being held by authorities in Arizona, is expected to be arraigned on the new charges Wednesday in Tucson, the district attorney's office said.",

         "(CNN) -- A grand jury has indicted Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, saying he abused his power by trying to pressure a district attorney to resign. The two felony counts against Perry, a Republican, stem from his threat to veto funding for a statewide public integrity unit run by Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg unless she stepped down, the special prosecutor in the case, Michael McCrum, said. Perry attorney David L. Botsford called the indictment a \"political abuse of the court system.\" He said the action \"violated the separation of powers\" and \"sets a dangerous precedent by allowing a grand jury to punish the exercise of a lawful and constitutional authority afforded to the Texas governor.\" CNN affiliate KVUE reported that Perry will have to report to the Travis County Jail in the capital of Austin to be booked, fingerprinted and have his photo made for a mugshot. Perry can continue to serve as governor while under indictment, KVUE reported. His attorneys could seek to have the charges thrown out, a motion that would delay the case, at the very least. The grand jury in Travis County indicted the governor on charges of coercion of a public servant and abuse of his official capacity. Read the indictment (PDF) The charges have serious political implications, both in Texas and beyond. Perry is entering his final few months in office after a historic 14-year run in Austin. The Republican running to replace Perry is state Attorney General Greg Abbott, who will have to answer questions about the legal drama. Abbott is facing off against Democratic star Wendy Davis, whose campaign is already making hay of Friday's news. Perry's presidential prospects could be damaged. It's an open secret he's laying groundwork for a second presidential campaign after his disastrous 2012 effort. The governor has positioned himself as an early conservative alternative to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, another GOP presidential contender. Perry is scheduled to visit the early primary states of New Hampshire and South Carolina in the coming weeks to meet with Republican activists and legislators. According to McCrum, the indictment alleges that the circumstances around Perry's veto threat amounted to a misuse of state money earmarked by the Legislature to fund the public integrity unit in Travis County run by Lehmberg. The second charge alleges that he improperly used the veto threat to get her to resign following her arrest on a drunk driving charge. She stayed in office. \"I'm ready to go forward (in) my task as district attorney. In this case, the grand jury has spoken and I'm going forward to carry out the duties that have been bestowed upon me,\" McCrum said. \"I feel confident about the charges that have been filed,\" he added. Mary Anne Wiley, general counsel for Perry's office, said the \"veto in question was made in accordance\" with the authority \"afforded to every governor\" under the state's constitution. \"We will continue to aggressively defend the governor's lawful and constitutional action, and believe we will ultimately prevail,\" Wiley said in a statement. Political opponents of Perry, who unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2012, urged him to resign. \"Governor Rick Perry has brought dishonor to his office, his family and the state of Texas,\" the Texas Democratic Party said in a statement. \"We call on Governor Perry to immediately step down from office.

         "(CNN)An Argentine prosecutor said Friday there is enough evidence to continue an investigation into whether President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner hid Iran's alleged role in a deadly 1994 bombing, a probe that paused after a different prosecutor died mysteriously last month. Federal Prosecutor Gerardo Pollicita filed a 61-page report essentially endorsing what prosecutor Alberto Nisman claimed before he died in January: that evidence shows Fernandez and other top officials tried to cover up Iran's alleged involvement in the bombing that killed 85 people at a Jewish center in Buenos Aires. Pollicita sent his report to a judge, who is expected to examine it next week after he returns from vacation. The judge can determine whether the case can proceed to trial. Nisman, a special prosecutor investigating the 1994 bombing of the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association, alleged last month that Iran was behind the attack, and that Fernandez, to help sweeten a trade deal, covered up Tehran's involvement. That trade deal, Nisman alleged, involved cash-strapped Argentina receiving Iranian oil in exchange for meat and grain. Nisman made the allegation in a nearly 300-page report. But on January 18, one day before he was to testify before lawmakers about his allegations, he was found dead in his apartment with a gunshot wound to the head. Nisman filled with fear before his death, friend says . In his trash can, investigators say, was a 6-month-old draft warrant for Fernandez's arrest. Fernandez initially called it a suicide, but a test found no gunpowder residue on Nisman's hands. Fernandez said a few days later that she didn't believe Nisman killed himself, alleging that some members of the country's intelligence agency fed Nisman false information about a cover-up and were responsible for his death. The President and the other accused government officials deny any cover-up in the bombing. Anibal Fernandez, the President's general secretary, said the allegations against Fernandez are \"a clear maneuver to destabilize democracy\" in the South American country. He also said the investigation lacks \"judicial value\" or \"importance.\" About 10 years ago, Nisman was appointed as special prosecutor to investigate the bombing by then-President Nestor Kirchner, Fernandez's late husband. Conspiracy theories aplenty in wake of prosecutor's death . CNN's Rafael Romo, Elwyn Lopez and Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.",

         "Warsaw, Poland (CNN) -- European football's governing body opened disciplinary proceedings Saturday against Croatia over what it said was racist behavior by its supporters during a Euro 2012 match against Italy. UEFA said it was acting over \"the setting-off and throwing of fireworks, and the improper conduct of supporters,\" including racist chants and the displaying of racist symbols. The UEFA Control and Disciplinary Body will deal with the case on Tuesday, it said. Croatia drew 1-1 in the match against Italy in Poznan on Thursday, with Mario Mandzukic scoring for the Croatians and Andrea Pirlo claiming a goal for Italy. UEFA president Michel Platini urged fans who are attending decisive matches on Saturday night to \"conduct themselves with dignity and respect.\" Russia plays Greece in Warsaw, while the Czech Republic plays Poland in Wroclaw. \"Of course, there is rivalry and passion, and all teams want to win -- but we must remember that the results on the pitch are what really matter,\" Platini said in a statement. \"EURO 2012 is a celebration of football and I invite the fans, the vast majority of whom have conducted themselves in an exemplary manner so far, to continue to do so for the remainder of the tournament.\" The issue of racism has threatened to mar the soccer tournament, which is being co-hosted by Poland and Ukraine. Members of the Dutch squad claimed to hear monkey noises during an open training session in Krakow, Poland, before the tournament started, though the Dutch FA opted not to lodge an official complaint with UEFA. In addition, family members of two black English players chose not to travel to the competition for fear of being subjected to racism. UEFA has already taken the step of writing a letter to the mayors of each host city asking for a zero-tolerance approach to racist abuse. UEFA's disciplinary body has also been busy since the tournament started just over a week ago. Russia has already been fined and handed a suspended points deduction for improper conduct against the Czech Republic, while also still awaiting the verdict of a UEFA investigation into alleged racist chanting during the match. The German Football Federation was fined $12,500 after its fans threw paper onto the pitch during a meeting with Portugal, with the Iberian team also ordered to pay $6,250 for delaying the start of the second half. A Danish player, Nicklas Bendtner, may also face sanctions next week after lowering his shorts during a game Wednesday to reveal that he was wearing underwear displaying the name of an Irish bookmaker named Paddy Power. Under the laws of the games as outlined by FIFA, the global body which governs soccer, undershorts must be the same color as the shorts worn by the player. His shorts were red but the Paddy Power undershirts were green. CNN's Claudia Dominguez and Tom McGowan contributed to this report.",

         "(CNN) -- Two issues -- security and immigration -- often get too much attention when it comes to talking about the U.S.-Mexico relationship, U.S. President Barack Obama said Thursday. Now, Obama said, it's time to forge deeper economic connections to create more jobs and more trade on both sides of the border. \"That's the focus of my visit,\" he told reporters after meeting with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto in the country's capital. But even as Obama and Peña Nieto pushed to shift the tone more toward trade and economics, security issues loomed large over Thursday's meeting. Peña Nieto said his government remains committed to fighting organized crime, but that the United States and Mexico must \"cooperate on the basis of mutual respect, to be more efficient in our security strategy that we are implementing in Mexico.\" Obama stressed that the countries will continue to cooperate closely on security, but he didn't specify how. \"I agreed to continue our close cooperation on security, even as that nature of that close cooperation will evolve,\" he said. It's up to the Mexican people, Obama said, \"to determine their security structures and how it engages with other nations, including the United States.\" In the meantime, he said, the United States remains committed to reducing the demand for drugs north of the border, and the southward flow of illegal guns and cash that help fuel violence. \"I think it's natural that a new administration here in Mexico is looking carefully at how it's going to approach what is obviously a serious problem,\" Obama said, \"and we are very much looking forward to cooperating in any ways that we can to battle organized crime.\" High-profile cartel takedowns were a hallmark of former President Felipe Calderon's tenure. Peña Nieto has vowed to take a different approach, focusing more on education problems and social inequality that he says fuel drug violence. The details of his policies are still coming into focus, and analysts say his government has deliberately tried to shift drug violence out of the spotlight. Before Obama's arrival, a spate of news reports this week on both sides of the border detailed changes in how Mexico cooperates with the United States. Under the new rules, all U.S. requests for collaboration with Mexican agencies will flow through a single office, Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong told Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency. It is a drastic change from recent years, when U.S. agents enjoyed widespread access to their Mexican counterparts. Critics have expressed concerns that Peña Nieto's government will turn a blind eye to cartels or negotiate with them -- something he repeatedly denied on the campaign trail last year. On Tuesday -- two days before Obama's arrival -- his government arrested the father-in-law of Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, head of Mexico's Sinaloa cartel and one of the country's most-wanted drug lords. Speaking to reporters after his meeting with Obama on Thursday, Peña Nieto emphasized the importance of reducing violence, and also the importance of Mexico's relationship with the United States extending beyond the drug war. \"We don't want to make this relationship targeted on one single issue,\" he said. \"We want to place particular emphasis on the potential in the economic relationship between Mexico and the United States.\" To achieve that goal, Peña Nieto said, the presidents agreed to create a new high-level group to discuss economic and trade relations between the two nations. The group, which will include Cabinet ministers from both countries and U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, will have its first meeting this fall, Peña Nieto said. Imports and exports between the United States and Mexico totaled nearly $500 billion last year, and before Obama's arrival officials on both sides of the border said economic relations would be a focal point during the U.S. president's visit. \"When the economy in Mexico has grown, and people have opportunity, a lot of our problems are solved, or we have the resources to solve them,\" Obama said Thursday. The emphasis on the economy Thursday was a significant shift, said Jason Marczak, director of policy at the Americas Society and Council of the Americas. \"The conversations between Mexico and the United States are changing,\" he told CNN en Español. Obama is scheduled to deliver a speech at the National Anthropology Museum in Mexico City on Friday morning. In the afternoon, he will travel to Costa Rica, where he will meet President Laura Chinchilla and other regional leaders. CNN's Mariano Castillo and CNN en Español's Juan Carlos Lopez and Mario Gonzalez contributed to this report.",

         "(CNN)  -- More than 100 police officers and others were searching Friday in a southeastern Louisiana parish for a murder suspect who escaped from jail with three other inmates, a law enforcement official said. Timothy Murray, 29, who is charged with murder, remains at large, authorities in Louisiana say. Searchers are still focusing inside St. Tammany Parish, on the northern shore of Lake Pontchartrain, 30 miles north of New Orleans, said Capt. George Bonnett of the St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Office. At large is Timothy Murray, 29, who is charged with murder, Bonnett said. Authorities believe Murray may have been injured during the escape, but Bonnett wouldn't elaborate. The inmates escaped about 9 p.m. Thursday from the St. Tammany Parish Jail in Covington, Bonnett said. As many as 250 sheriff's deputies, Covington police officers, Louisiana State police and corrections officials were involved in the search overnight, using dogs, two helicopters and thermal-imaging equipment loaned from Livingston Parish, Bonnett said. The other three men were found about 1:30 a.m. Friday in a wooded area about a mile from the jail, he said. Three of the inmates were awaiting trial; one already had been convicted, Bonnett said. The captured inmates were Gary Slaydon, 27; Eric Buras, 30, and Jason Gainey, 27. Slaydon is charged with attempted murder. Buras is a murder suspect and Gainey has been convicted of murder, Bonnett said. He said the escape was not discovered until a resident and Covington police reported seeing what appeared to be inmates in jail uniforms walking down a street. About the time those calls came in, jailers were doing a routine head count and found the four men missing, Bonnett said. He said the means of escape was under investigation, but it has been determined that their escape wasn't due to human error. He repeated what St. Tammany Parish Sheriff Jack Strain said early Friday: \"Four inmates were able to defeat the structure of the maximum security area of our jail.\" Deputies have canvassed neighborhoods, going door to door to warn residents that an inmate is still at large.",

         "(CNN) -- The snowfall might be subsiding in the Buffalo area but officials are warning people the deadly weather emergency is not close to being over. Especially with rain in the weekend forecast. Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz told reporters Thursday that while the storm may be largely over for snow purposes, authorities are exceptionally worried that buildings will collapse when the heavy snow pack soaks up the rain. \"There's going to be a warm-up on Saturday, there will probably not be a tremendous amount of melt on Saturday,\" he said. \"There will be a rain starting on Saturday that will not initially create a situation where the snow will melt, but it will actually act as a sponge. So the water that is falling will go into the snow pack and will actually act as a sponge until it finally starts releasing it.\" The National Weather Service forecasts light rain to begin Saturday and temperatures to warm. The major concern is flooding, but Poloncarz said the weight on buildings could cause some to collapse. \"There will be even extra weight because of the rain. So this emergency is not over,\" he warned. On Thursday afternoon, Erie County officials said there was a \"significant threat of a roof collapse\" at the 184-bed Garden Gate Health Care Facility in Cheektowaga. Residents reported wall cracks and a sagging ceiling. Several feet of snow piled on the roof. Poloncarz, who had earlier tweeted that the roof was collapsing, later clarified the statement, saying beams in the building were twisted and walls cracked. No injuries were reported and patients were evacuated. Residents were taken temporarily to a business park, said Scott Zylka with the Erie County Sheriff's Office, adding that the roof structure was compromised. The extreme weather has claimed at least 10 lives -- its latest victims two people with mental health issues who died of apparent exposure overnight, Dr. Gale R. Burstein, Erie County health commissioner, said Thursday. And the storm forced the NFL to announce that Sunday's game between Buffalo and the New York Jets, scheduled to be played at the Bills' Ralph Wilson Stadium, will be hosted at Detroit's Ford Field on Monday night. Seeking shelter . At the Winchester Volunteer Fire Company station on Harlem Street, as many as 40 people stranded in the snow have sought shelter since Tuesday. More than 6 feet of snow cover the streets. Abandoned cars are barely visible under the drifts. Fire trucks can't leave the station. Attempts by firefighters to get out in an SUV were futile. One medic hopped on a snowmobile to rush to a call. Other volunteers jumped on ATVs to reach a home where the roof was buckling under the weight of the snow. Maria Odom's two cats and a dog were rescued from the house. \"I'm ready for it to end,\" Odom, 38, said of the extreme weather. \"I've lived here my whole life and I've never seen anything like this.\" At the fire station, driver Steve Randall's truckload of milk and eggs has served as the main source of provisions. Randall said he was stuck in his truck for nearly five hours before making his way to the firehouse, where people have been sleeping on tables to stay off the cold floor. \"We've been eating like kings for a while but now we're running out of food,\" he said. Firehouse occupants have been making quiche, served with milk and bread from a store across the street. From the Tops grocery store nearby, people hauling bags of food headed out into the snow by foot. One man dragged groceries in a sled; another pulled his child through the snow in a laundry basket. Robert Mead embarked on a five-mile trek to bring formula to his 9-month-old baby. A year's snowfall in 3 days? In the past 24 hours, since the latest lake-effect storm started on Wednesday night, more than 3 feet of snow has fallen in several areas near Buffalo. In Wales Center, there was a new snowfall of 37 inches, according to a National Weather Service spotter. Residents just stared out their windows at the mounds of white stuff, if they could see out at all. In East Aurora, Lisa Gutekunst's home was capped with more than 4 feet of snow, she said. \"The snow is coming down so hard you can't see out the window,\" she said earlier Thursday. \"We've cleared our driveway so many times that we've run out of places to put the snow.\" Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown announced a travel ban in south Buffalo for both cars and pedestrians from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m., citing the safety of residents as heavy equipment moved around town. If the forecast holds, more than a year's worth of snow will have fallen in three days. In a typical year, Buffalo's snowfall totals about 7 feet, according to the National Weather Service. Extreme conditions lead to tragedy . Ten people have died, including four who suffered cardiac issues while they shoveled snow and one who died in a car accident, Erie County officials reported. A man in his 60s had a heart attack while he tried to move a snow plow or a snow blower, Erie County deputy executive Richard Tobe said. Burstein told reporters that two residents of Niagara and Erie counties died overnight Thursday of apparent exposure. \"They both had chronic illnesses,\" she said. \"They both had mental health issues, and were found outside either their home or a close friend's home. They had probably been there overnight.\" In Alden, a 46-year-old man was found dead inside a car buried in 12 to 15 feet of snow. In Genesee County, Jack Boyce, a 56-year-old county employee, died after collapsing Tuesday morning while operating a snow blower outside the county sheriff's office, according to County Manager Jay Gsell. Brown and city officials recounted stories of rescuers trudging around snowdrifts as high as houses to get people to hospitals, and police officers delivering special baby formula to a pair of infants. A sporting chance . Wednesday night's football game between the University of Buffalo and Kent State was postponed because the visitors' equipment truck didn't arrive on time. The game has been tentatively rescheduled for Friday, school officials said in a statement. The National Football League announced it would move Sunday's game from Ralph Wilson Stadium, which was buried in an estimated 220,000 tons of snow. The NFL statement said the contest will be played Monday night at 7 ET at Ford Field, which in 2010 played host to a Minnesota Vikings game after the roof of their stadium collapsed due to snow accumulation. Moving the game back a day will help the Bills, who haven't been able to practice this week. The team had been offering tickets to the game and $10 an hour to anyone willing to help remove the snow. Now it is offering refunds to fans who purchased tickets through the team. CNN's Alexandra Field, Leigh Remizowski, Ashley Fantz, Jason Hanna, Ed Payne, Marcus Hooper, Martin Savidge and Catherine E.

         "(CNN) -- The 20th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards nominations were announced Wednesday morning, and as one of the leading awards show salvos in what is expected to be a competitive season, what didn't get nominated was as notable as what did. Robert Redford was left out. So was anybody from \"Inside Llewyn Davis.\" \"Captain Phillips\" missed out on a best ensemble nomination, and \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" came up completely empty. A number of films did get good news. Awards Season 2014 . \"12 Years a Slave\" was nominated for four awards -- best ensemble, best male actor (Chewitel Ejiofor), best supporting male actor (Michael Fassbender) and best supporting female actor (Lupita Nyong'o). Though \"12 Years\" has narrowly missed topping year-end best-of lists so far -- and has even been left out entirely on some -- it's been considered an Academy Award shoo-in since its release in October, and the SAGs do nothing to stall its momentum. On the other hand, \"August: Osage County,\" the sprawling comedy-drama based on the Tracy Letts play, has been generally ignored on critics' best-of lists. (\"Good but not great\" is the consensus so far. ) But it also did well at the SAG nominations, earning three nods, for ensemble, lead female actor Meryl Streep and supporting female actor Julia Roberts. \"Dallas Buyers Club\" also did well, earning nominations for ensemble, lead actor Matthew McConaughey and supporting actor Jared Leto. \"Lee Daniels' The Butler\" and \"American Hustle\" complete the list of nominees for best ensemble, the SAG Awards' closest equivalent to best picture. \"The Butler\" also earned nods for stars Forest Whitaker (best actor) and Oprah Winfrey (female supporting actor). Jennifer Lawrence added to \"Hustle's\" haul with a female supporting actor nomination. And \"Captain Phillips,\" though snubbed in the ensemble category, picked up nominations for star Tom Hanks and a surprise nod for supporting actor Barkhad Abdi. \"Phillips\" is the film debut for Abdi, a Somali immigrant who plays a ship hijacker. But there are a number of Oscar favorites that couldn't get into the ring. \"Her,\" the Spike Jonze work about a man who develops a relationship with a computer operating system, was completely shut out. So was \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" the new Martin Scorsese film, despite excellent early buzz. Keep up to date on who has won what with our Awards tracker . Redford, whose one-man show in \"All Is Lost\" has made him a favorite for best actor, was left off SAG's list. So were Oscar Isaac (from the Coen brothers' latest, \"Inside Llewyn Davis,\" which came up completely empty), Michael B. Jordan (\"Fruitvale Station\") and \"American Hustle's\" Amy Adams and Christian Bale. The most unlikely nominees were focused in the supporting actor category. Besides Abdi, Daniel Bruhl picked up a nomination for Ron Howard's mostly overlooked \"Rush,\" and the late James Gandolfini was honored for his work in the comedy \"Enough Said.\" Though the actors' wing represents the biggest bloc of Oscar voters, the SAG Awards aren't always a great bellwether of best picture success at the Academy Awards. Though \"Argo,\" last year's best picture, also won the SAG Awards' ensemble honor, the 18th annual SAGs went with \"The Help\" over \"The Artist\" and the 16th annual awards tapped \"Inglorious Basterds\" over \"The Hurt Locker.\" The picks for actor and actress, on the other hand, are much closer to the academy's selections. Last year's SAGs went to Daniel Day-Lewis and Lawrence; the year before honored Jean Dujardin (though Viola Davis lost the Oscar to Streep); and 2010 SAGs went to Colin Firth and Natalie Portman. Does it mean anything? Thursday may muddy the waters further, when the Hollywood Foreign Press Association announces the Golden Globe nominations. TNT and TBS will air the 20th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards on January 18.",

         "New York (CNN) -- The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, prompted the U.S. to take sensible security measures and launch a justified counterattack against al Qaeda, says analyst Fareed Zakaria. But he says they also led to an overreaction that continues today. Zakaria argues the organization behind the attacks, al Qaeda, has been greatly diminished by the U.S. response to 9/11 and by growing opposition to the group in the Muslim world: . \"All these trends have worked to further diminish the threat al Qaeda poses to us. We're in a strange situation where the right doesn't want to acknowledge it because it would suggest we don't need to be in quite this much of a war footing and ... the left seems reluctant to accept some of this because it suggests that, God forbid, George W. Bush might have done something right. \"As a result of our political dysfunction, we have lost the ability to have a rational conversation about 9/11,\" Zakaria said. The author and host of CNN's \"Fareed Zakaria GPS\" spoke to CNN on Wednesday. Here is an edited transcript: . CNN: Is the U.S. safer today than before 9/11? Fareed Zakaria: There's no question we're safer. Look, 9/11 changed the way in which we viewed the problem of terrorism and Islamic radicalism, and we've gotten attentive to both. First of all, there have been huge measures taken -- a series of very simple, sensible measures that decrease the likelihood of anything like 9/11 happening. Sealing the cockpit door, by itself, means that a plane can never be used as a missile and things like that ... the security measures have made it much more difficult for high-value targets to be vulnerable in quite the way they were. The second part is that we have gone after these al Qaeda and associated groups quite vigorously, chasing them around the mountains of Afghanistan of course but also tracking their money. And those things collectively have made a big difference, and there's no question in my mind, we're safer. Now we can begin to ask ourselves whether we have overdone the countermeasures, whether the tens of billions of dollars that have been added year after year to the intelligence budget, to the Homeland Security budget have been all necessary or are we on a kind of autopilot where no request for homeland security can ever be denied, and it has become part of the gargantuan pork barrel projects in Washington. CNN: You've written that we've overreacted to 9/11 and al Qaeda. In what way do you think that's the case? Zakaria: I mean it in two senses. We didn't spend a lot of time in the year after 9/11 -- once we had taken it on, once we had started chasing these people around the world, measures which I strongly supported then and still strongly support -- whether that had been effective and whether we had broken up the organization and made it far more difficult for them to operate. And therefore, what was the real nature of the threat going forward? I think it's clear that al Qaeda is a much-diminished force. It has the power to inspire a series of local organizations around the world, but it has very little power to direct these high-profile terrorist attacks itself. The reaction to my point that al Qaeda is weaker than we think has surprised me only because I've made this point since 2004, and I've made it repeatedly. CNN: Why do you think many people have not agreed with that point? Zakaria: I do think we have a tendency in the United States to underestimate the evil intentions of our enemies, but overestimate their capacity, their capabilities. What we now know, based on all the declassified documents we have available is that in the 1970s and '80s, the U.S. was massively overestimating the military capacity of the Soviet Union. CNN: In what way? Zakaria: If you look at every measure, from bombers to missiles, on almost every count, we massively overestimated their capacity to modernize, their capacity to build up, and as a result we had created a much, much larger military-industrial complex than would have been necessary to combat the actual Soviet threat rather than the one we perceived. Similarly with Saddam Hussein, the intelligence agencies were absolutely convinced that what we faced was a very powerful state that was acquiring nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, which proved to be largely untrue. When we look at al Qaeda, we have to ask ourselves: What is their actual capacity to inflict harm? The second sense in which I mean it is I do think there is a tendency within the American appropriations system for projects to become eternal and eternally expanding and this has clearly become true of homeland security. Nobody wants to deny the request for more security, more measures, more procedures, all of which come with more budgets, more bureaucrats ... CNN: So what should be done now? Zakaria: This would be the right time for us to take a look and ask ourselves, in order to combat the actual threat that al Qaeda poses, which is real but which is limited in some senses -- what kind of intelligence apparatus do we need, what kind of homeland security apparatus do we need and how much can we do in terms in reallocating, reorganizing and reinventing these national security agencies rather than constantly piling up layer upon layer. We now have 15 different intelligence agencies, we have 15 different organizations tracking the money that terrorists are moving around. It's almost as though we took the entire Cold War bureaucracy and rather than scaling it down and reconfiguring it to meet this new set of unconventional threats, we just layered on top of the mountains of Cold War bureaucracy another set of mountains of terrorism bureaucracy, never mind that the Cold War is over ... This is not a way to run a serious national security policy. And the greatest danger here of course is that unlike the Cold War, unlike World War II, this is not a war that has a clean ending, so you cannot set a point at which we would demobilize and therefore get rid of some of this apparatus. This is a kind of existential reality that the United States has to deal with, the possibility of terrorism, the possibility of radical groups being able to inflict harm on an open society, so we've got to ask ourselves is this the normal national security state we want to live with. CNN: Was the concept of a \"war on terror\" mistaken? Zakaria: I don't know if I would quibble with it that much. ... The problem of course is that terrorism is a tactic, you can't declare war against a tactic. But in general it conveyed the idea that we needed to go on the offense and we needed to chase these guys around the world, we needed to track their money. I have no problem with any of that ... the problem is you can fight a war but you also need to actively gauge the strength of your opponent, and if you think he's 25 feet tall vs. five feet tall, that's important. That's a huge misdiagnosis of the problem ... CNN: Why do you think people have missed the change in al Qaeda's capabilities? Zakaria: We're not looking at trends within the Islamic world where al Qaeda has been politically discredited, trends that are taking place within the jihadi community, where prominent jihadis have broken with al Qaeda. The reality is that al Qaeda has been unable to organize a single attack [against a major target in recent years], the reality is that when smaller local groups plan terrorist attacks all they can attack are local targets like cafes or train stations and thus kill locals, further alienating the local population and discrediting and delegitimizing al Qaeda and its associated groups. CNN: Nine years after 9/11, why is the debate about Islam and terrorism fiercer than it's ever been? Zakaria: What's more strange is that it feels as though it's a debate that's taking place without the intervening nine years. Sometimes the debate seems as though it could have been taking place in 2002, without noticing all these trends that I've been describing. 9/11 was a wake-up call for America, but it also was a wake-up call for a lot of people in the Muslim world. In the early months after 9/11, and I wrote about this at the time, there was a sense in the Muslim world that while they might not have approved of the attacks, they understood the anti-Americanism that lay behind it. That kind of totally irresponsible and pernicious implicit support for Islamic radicalism has worn very thin in the last nine years. CNN: Why has radicalism lost support? Zakaria: People who felt that way in Indonesia, in Jordan, even in Palestine have realized that these guys [al Qaeda] are as opposed to the secular regimes of Indonesia, Jordan and in the Palestinian Authority as they are to the United States and when they attack Indonesia and Jordan, they kill innocent Indonesians and Jordanians, innocent Muslims by the way. That reality has also produced a kind of rethinking about Islamic extremism that has been very important. I should emphasize that it is not enough and there needs to be more persistent condemnation of radicalism and violence but there's no question, and the polling data make this clear, the number of fatwas issued against al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden make this clear -- there has been a huge shift in the Muslim world over the last nine years. CNN: Finally, Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf is reaffirming his plans to proceed with Cordoba House, the controversial Islamic center near ground zero. What do you think of that? Zakaria: This is to be a community center that will have a swimming pool, meeting rooms, athletic facilities, modeled after the 92nd Street Y. It will have Jews and Christians and Muslims on its board, it will have prayer rooms for Jews and Christians as well as Muslims. It will have both physical spaces and programs to encourage interfaith dialogue. Now to me that sounds like precisely the American answer to Muslim radicalism, to affirm a Muslim-led process of interfaith dialogue, of tolerance for other religions ... the plan here is to build a center that is really trying to bring people together, this is such an American response to intolerance, extremism and violence. It is about inclusion, dialogue and respect for other faiths.",

         "NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- Gangs of young men armed with machetes are roaming the streets in Kenya as post-election violence threatens to engulf the country. Horrific attacks are being reported, including the torching of a church where people who had sought refuge were burned alive. At least 148 people have been killed and about 75,000 have fled their homes since President Mwai Kibaki won a narrow victory, according to Kenyan government officials. The Associated Press reported a higher number -- about 275 -- have died since Saturday. Much of the violence is between supporters of Kibaki from the majority Kikuyu tribe and backers of opposition leader Raila Odinga, who is from the Luo tribe. The ethnic violence, previously rare in Kenya, is reminiscent of the strife that led to the Rwanda genocide.  In a particularly disturbing incident, a mob appears to have burned a church filled with Kenyans seeking refuge from the violence. The Red Cross told The Associated Press that at least 50 were burned to death at the church, some of them children.   As many as 200 people were at the church, about 185 miles northwest of Nairobi, KTN reporter Tony Biwott told CNN. Watch as machete-wielding looters haul away goods » . Biwott said he counted at least 15 charred bodies, including children, in the burned church and an adjacent field. \"I'm sure there were more than 15 but I couldn't count the ones who were ashes,\" he said in a phone interview. The wounded sustained gunshot wounds, burns and cuts from a panga, a machete-like weapon, the Red Cross said. Watch smoke darken skies near a burned church . The national police commissioner has said in Kenyan society, churches are considered sacred and no one would expect such violence there. He said an investigation into the incident is under way. About 120 people are reported dead and over 1,000 injured countrywide, according to The Red Cross. Police and political backers of opposition leader Raila Odinga began clashing about four days ago as Odinga, of the Luo tribe, narrowly lost Kenya's presidential election to Mwai Kibaki. Kibaki is a member of Kikuyu, Kenya's largest tribe. Violence broke out in several cities as frustration mounted during the slow hand-count of the ballots. Kibaki was re-elected with 51.3 percent of the vote, to 48.7 percent for Odinga. \"What we now witness is a cold and calculated plan to organize and engage in massacres,\" government spokesman Alfred Mutua said. Bringing in the New Year, Kibaki -- who rarely speaks to the press -- urged calm to the nation. \"It now is a time for healing and reconciliation amongst all Kenyans,\" he said. Foreign Minister Raphael Tuju said the government is committed to taking control. \"If the tear gas doesn't work then unfortunately they have to use live bullets,\" he told CNN. \"The president has been sworn in, the elections are over, the Kenyans have to accept the results, the opposition has to accept the results.\" Tuesday, international observers said the balloting fell short of international standards for democratic elections. Alexander Lambsdorff, the head of the EU Election Observation Mission in Kenya, cited discrepancies in vote counts, election observers being turned away from polling places and observers being refused entrance to the electoral commission vote-counting room. The violence also has displaced some 75,000 Kenyans inside the country, Mutua said. The government said Tuesday it will not allow any political rallies in the aftermath of the controversial election outcome. Odinga's opposition Orange Democratic Movement had scheduled rallies for Tuesday, raising fears of more violence. Mutua said there was no intention to impose a state of emergency or curfew at this point, and said police are handling the violence well and with \"extreme restraint.\" However, he warned that police restraint would not last forever. The violence is rare for Kenya, which has enjoyed relative calm even as war and chronic political violence wracked neighboring countries, such as Ethiopia, Sudan and Uganda. The United States has withheld congratulations for Kibaki, citing concerns of voting problems, even though Kibaki has claimed victory. E-mail to a friend .",

         "(CNN) -- When Superstorm Sandy hit the eastern United States and the country's largest city, millions of residents across our five boroughs felt its impact and devastation. Many of us felt vulnerable, unsure what the next days would bring. Communities are still reeling from the aftermath and the most difficult period may still be ahead. But as our city begins to rebuild and recover, New Yorkers and others in the region who already struggle on a regular basis will have the hardest time getting back on their feet. Thankfully, we've seen a huge outpouring of support and number of people willing to donate their time and resources to help. And for those willing to pitch in, please join us. Our government is certainly doing its best to help those in need in the aftermath of the storm, but the nonprofit sector plays such a critical role in the delivery of health and human services across New York City and throughout the country. Numerous low-income families depend on vital community-based nonprofits to access the services they need for daily living. That is one reason why United Way created the United Way Hurricane Sandy Recovery Fund (#sandyfund). Local United Ways along the Eastern Seaboard will use contributions to the fund to address the near- and long-term recovery needs of communities most affected by the hurricane. In addition, the fund will bolster United Way community impact partners that serve hurricane-affected individuals and families who are already vulnerable -- struggling with food insecurity and the ability meet their most basic needs. Disasters like this unprecedented storm undoubtedly impact all of our communities. Our most under-resourced communities, however, have been trying to make ends meet even before Sandy barreled in. For the third straight year, New York City's poverty rate has been on the rise according to census bureau data, with one in five New Yorkers lacking enough income and earnings to pay for basic necessities. In fact, United Way of New York City's most recent hunger survey found that two-thirds of New Yorkers were concerned that someone they know will need help getting and paying for food in the next 12 months. Map: See images of destruction, recovery across the East Coast . These financial pressures are exacerbated when an unexpected hardship like a natural disaster strikes. Some families' primary earners continue to lose hourly wages because they can't get to work. In other cases, those jobs no longer exist as flooded offices and businesses have been forced to close. The loss of even a week's income can be devastating, never mind being suddenly thrust into unemployment. Plus, tens of thousands of New Yorkers will be displaced for weeks to come. Some may be unable to return to their homes at all. It is not the first time United Way has stepped in to help those most in need. For example, following the 9/11 attacks, United Way of New York City created the September 11th Fund in partnership with The New York Community Trust, raising and distributing more than $500 million. Following the devastating earthquake in Haiti in 2010, United Way of NYC partnered with the Brooklyn Community Foundation to found and fund the NYC Haitian Hope & Healing Fund to address the short- and long-term needs of affected individuals residing in New York. And following last year's Hurricane Irene, United Way of New York State set up the Hurricane Irene Recovery Fund to help those in need. Our needs today remain just as great. Early estimates put Sandy's damage at $30 billion to $50 billion in losses. Let's not forget about our already struggling low-income families who will feel these losses deeply.",

         "Washington (CNN) -- After weeks of U.S. and NATO bombardment, about one-third of Moammar Gadhafi's ground armor has been destroyed, as well as most of the fixed air defense sites and aircraft, but a stalemate between government and rebel forces is emerging and could last for some time, according to a senior U.S. official with direct knowledge of the latest military assessments. The official agreed to speak Monday only on background because of the sensitive nature of the information. The official said the latest U.S. and NATO view is that both sides essentially remain in their fixed positions -- the rebels near Ajdabiya and the pro-government forces near al-Brega. Rebels say no to African Union-brokered deal . \"Neither side has the wherewithal to move,\" the official said. Rebels do not have the manpower, vehicles or weapons to make major advances. And while Gadhafi's forces continue their attacks, especially in Misrata, the source said they are suffering from a lack of supplies, ammunition and fuel because of airstrikes. The official said that a major ground force movement would put Gadhafi's units in the cross hairs of NATO airstrikes. Airstrikes have rebels clinging to hope . That said, the official acknowledged strongly that the onslaught by Gadhafi forces in Misrata has put people there in a dire situation. The official described a military scenario in which the United States and NATO have direct knowledge of civilians being killed but have been unable to act because Gadhafi forces and armor are so mixed with civilian populations, it's become impossible to launch airstrikes against them. The United States and NATO also think that Gadhafi's forces still have as many as 15,000 shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles, which has resulted in limited use of AC-130 aircraft, which are vulnerable to being shot down as they fly low and slow to engage in the type of precision airstrikes needed in a place like Misrata. The attacks also have affected Gadhafi's ability to communicate with his commanders. He is still having face-to-face meetings with key associates, the official said, but is largely unable to communicate directly with units in the field. There are still some fiber-optic communications capabilities as well as communications nodes in schools and mosques that are very difficult to strike. Report tracks \"sweeping changes\" in Mideast . On the other side, another senior U.S. official who is familiar with administration contacts with the opposition said the opposition's leadership seems to be sincere and earnest about its aim of toppling Gadhafi, but the leaders are not as organized as they need to be. They lack a detailed plan. The rebel military forces and their abilities are \"still a bit of a mystery,\" the officials said. \"... Their resources are limited and their strategies and tactics are hard to fathom.\" While they are holding on to Ajdabiya for the moment, the senior official said it is hard to imagine them making any further gains toward Tripoli. CNN's Elise Labott contributed to this report.",

         "Washington (CNN) -- Grimacing with emotion, entertainment legend Mickey Rooney implored a Senate committee on Wednesday to stop what experts call chronic emotional, physical, sexual and financial abuse of elderly Americans by family members and other caregivers. The 90-year-old Rooney told the Senate Special Committee on Aging that he was abused by a family member who took control of his life, and described feeling \"scared, disappointed, yes, and angry.\" \"You can't believe that it's happening to you,\" Rooney said. \"You feel overwhelmed.\" Rooney has filed a restraining order against his stepson and stepdaughter, claiming both emotional and financial abuse. The committee's hearing brought attention to what experts call chronic elder abuse in America. Rooney said Congress should pass a law to make it a specific crime. \"I'm asking you to stop this elderly abuse. I mean to stop it. Now. Not tomorrow, not next month, but now,\" he shouted from the witness table. Pass legislation and send it to be signed into law by President Barack Obama, he urged, so that the nation can say \"it's a crime and we will not allow it in the United States of America.\" Following the hearing, committee Chairman Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wisconsin, introduced legislation that would create an Office of Elder Justice within the Department of Justice to help coordinate law enforcement response to elder abuse. According to a report by the Government Accountability Office, more than 14% of noninstitutionalized older adults experienced some form of elder abuse in 2009. The report cautions that number may be lower than the reality because many instances of elder abuse are underreported. \"For years I suffered silently. I didn't want to tell anybody. I couldn't muster the courage and you have to have courage,\" Rooney said Wednesday. \"I needed help and I knew I needed it. Even when I tried to speak up, I was told to shut up and be quiet.\" The GAO report found that many Adult Protective Service programs at the state level have growing case loads and dwindling resources. The elder population of the United States is expected to grow by 60% over the next 25 years. Other witnesses detailed the depth of the problem. \"I tell the physicians I train that if they've seen 15 or 20 older people in their practices ... then they have probably met an elder abuse victim, whether they realize it or not,\" said Dr. Mark Lachs, director of geriatrics at the New York Presbyterian Health System. Based on a new study of elder abuse in New York state, \"it would appear that for every elder abuse victim that makes it into an official service or reporting system, another 23 to 24 go undetected,\" Lachs said. Marie-Therese Connolly, director of the group Life Long Justice, told of a man charged by prosecutors in Seattle with murdering his mother. \"His crime? Letting her rot to death with eight huge pressure sores, several to the bone, while he played internet poker and lived off her pension,\" Connolly said. \"His excuse? She didn't want to go to a nursing home or a doctor; he was just respecting her wishes.\" According to Connolly, the woman was \"imprisoned in her bed by immobility, dementia and isolation.\" \"She moaned and cried out for help continuously in the weeks before her death,\" Connolly said. \"Neighbors closed their windows and her son put in earplugs to muffle her cries. No one called Adult Protective Services or 911. It's hard to believe the response would have been the same had the cries come from a child, a younger woman or a dog.\" The witnesses noted that victims of elder abuse put a greater strain on support services by requiring more medical care, housing assistance and other help. Rooney summed up the challenge when he spoke of the personal difficulty that victims of elder abuse face. \"You're afraid, but you're also thinking about your other family members,\" he said, noting concern about potential criticism from \"your family, your friends, people who know them.\" \"They might not want to accept the dysfunction,\" Rooney said, adding that \"one should love their families as I do. I love my family.\" The diminutive Rooney has been a film star for decades, starting with his role in Andy Hardy films in the 1930s. CNN's Sally Holland contributed to this story.",

         "(CNN) -- Police in Colombia have arrested four people accused of killing a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent during an attempted robbery. Colombia's National Police said the four suspects they arrested were part of a criminal network of thieves. Two additional suspects who were allegedly involved in the crime remain on the loose, CNN affiliate Caracol TV reported. The United States will request extradition of the suspects, but it has not yet done so formally, a law enforcement official said. U.S. officials have extradited and prosecuted suspects accused of killing U.S. federal agents in the past. Special Agent James \"Terry\" Watson, assigned to the DEA unit in Cartagena, was on temporary duty in Bogota when he died after being stabbed in a taxi cab last Thursday night, officials said. Authorities have said they do not believe the attack was connected to his work for the U.S. agency. \"The homicide of the DEA agent was committed by common criminals and was not connected to his work in Colombia,\" National Police Director Gen. Jose Roberto Leon Riano said, according to Caracol. U.S. officials praised Colombian authorities Tuesday for their swift investigation. \"The Drug Enforcement Administration is grateful for the outstanding work of the Colombian National Police, the Special Investigative Unit and the Attorney General's Office that led to the swift arrest of these suspects,\" DEA Administrator Michele M. Leonhart said in a written statement. \"We will never forget Special Agent Watson and his sacrifice, as well as all those who have given their lives for the rule of law. We salute the brave and expeditious work of Colombian law enforcement and we look forward to justice being served.\" Watson, 42, had been watching the last game of the NBA finals at a Bogota restaurant Thursday night and left in a taxi, a State Department spokesman said last week. Investigators believe Watson's cab stopped at a traffic light and his assailants jumped out of two other cabs, which pulled up on either side of the vehicle in which he was riding, a law enforcement official said. According to the official, Watson managed to escape from the cab and was taken to a hospital, where he died. In Colombia, such attacks are known as \"millionaire rides.\" Authorities said the suspects they arrested were part of a gang known for millionaire ride robberies. The DEA said Watson was a 13-year veteran of the agency. He had been sent to Afghanistan three times on counternarcotics trafficking assignments and had previously served in the Army and worked for the U.S. Marshals Service. Attorney General Eric Holder is scheduled to speak at a funeral service for Watson in Louisiana on Wednesday.",

         "(CNN) -- Yaya Toure believes that Manchester City can become like his all-conquering former club Barcelona, the midfielder told CNN. After being criticized for defensive play last season, City boss Roberto Mancini has taken the English Premier League by storm with an all-out attacking style. Ivory Coast international Toure, who moved to Eastlands from the Camp Nou in a $38 million deal in July 2010, said that with the current wealth of expensive talent City can rival the European and Spanish champions' free-flowing passing style. The arrival of Sergio Aguero and Samir Nasri has meant City have not missed wantaway former captain Carlos Tevez, while David Silva has blossomed along with Edin Dzeko and Mario Balotelli for the 2011 FA Cup winners. \"Last year was difficult, because some of the media criticized City for defending more than attack,\" Toure said. \"(Now) the boss plays with a different system ... Sami Nasri, Edin Dzeko is playing fantastic now, Aguero, Silva is unbelievable.\" Toure scored the goal that ended City's 35-year wait for a trophy at Wembley in May, and he said that if Mancini's men can maintain the form that has taken them top of the English table then they can be a serious threat to Barca's dominance. \"For me it's important that you have to first win something, and last year we did it. But this year, I think if we continue like that, if we win a couple more cups, maybe we can be like them, because Barcelona is this fantastic machine of football,\" the 28-year-old said. \"I'm full of confidence this year, I think this year is going to be amazing for us.\" City qualified for the Europe's top club competition for the first time since 1969, and have a great chance of progressing into the knockout stage of the Champions League despite being drawn in a so-called \"Group of Death\" along with Bayern Munich, Napoli and Villarreal. \"I think you have to go step by step because for me, for the moment, the Premier League is the most important league,\" Toure said. \"But we focus on the Champions League. \"The Champions League is one of the best competitions in the world, so many great teams there. I think if we get some luck, we can go far.\" Toure will miss a vital chunk of City's season when he heads to Gabon and Equatorial Guinea in January for the month-long African Cup of Nations. The Ivory Coast's \"Elephants,\" drawn in Group B with Burkina Faso, Sudan and Angola, are among the favorites to win the tournament for the first time since 1992, with several of the usual big-name countries not qualifying. Toure's home country is recovering from the civil war that broke out in March after former president Laurent Gbagbo refused to stand down despite losing the November 2010 elections, plus floods that hit Abidjan in June. \"Everybody in my country they are waiting for this cup. And, I think we can only give them the happiness if we win this cup, because the guys from there they need it a lot.\" While Manchester United's status as one of the world's most popular clubs remains intact, Toure's presence at City along with his older brother Kolo has helped change the balance among supporters back home. \"Now I see the fans are very proud to put on the blue shirt of the club,\" he said. \"And now I think the image of City is starting to change. I hope God helps us to continue to win something, which will make a lot of people happy.\"",

         "Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The cholera epidemic already blamed for more than 1,100 deaths in Haiti could worsen because of poor sanitation in the earthquake-ravaged country, U.S. medical researchers reported Thursday. A lack of treated drinking water, coupled with poor hand hygiene and food-preparation practices, make the 1.3 million people still living in camps particularly vulnerable, according to a new study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"The course of the cholera outbreak in Haiti is difficult to predict,\" the report states. \"The Haitian population has no pre-existing immunity to cholera, and environmental conditions in Haiti are favorable for its continued spread.\" Jordan Tappero, a CDC epidemiologist in Haiti, said Haitian authorities and aid agencies are working to limit the epidemic by emphasizing clean water and sanitation. But he added, \"We expect we will be working very hard for many months to come.\" Haiti has not reported a cholera outbreak in more than a century. The current epidemic was first reported in October and has now spread to eight of the Caribbean nation's 10 provinces, the CDC found. Reports linking the outbreak to Nepalese troops from the U.N. peacekeeping mission MINUSTAH sparked riots in the northern port city of Cap-Haitien on Tuesday. A new round of violent protests erupted Thursday in the capital Port-au-Prince, eyewitnesses told CNN. U.N. officials have denied the Nepalese were to blame for the outbreak. The CDC has said the strain of the cholera bacteria responsible is \"indistinguishable\" from one found in other parts of the world, including south Asia, but researchers are unlikely to be able to pinpoint how it arrived in Haiti. \"The reality is that we have a serious problem here,\" CDC spokeswoman Lola Russell said. The emphasis is on controlling the outbreak, \"so that more people do not become ill and potentially die from cholera.\" The epidemic comes as Haiti -- already the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere -- struggles to recover from the January earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people. Even before the quake, only 12 percent of the Haitian population of 9.8 million received treated tap water and only 17 percent had access to adequate sanitation, the CDC noted. \"The water safety and sanitation systems in Haiti were weak be before the earthquake and made weaker by the earthquake, so conditions are ripe for the further spread of cholera,\" Tappero told CNN. Some symptoms of cholera, an acute, bacterial illness caused by drinking tainted water, can be mild or even nonexistent. But the disease can cause profuse watery diarrhea and vomiting, leading to death by rapid dehydration. The heart of the outbreak is the Haitian province of Artibonite, north of Port-au-Prince. Interviews with victims hospitalized in the first days of the outbreak found that two-thirds of them had been drinking untreated water from rivers or canals, the same percentage did not routinely use chlorine to sanitize drinking water and nearly four out of five defecated in the open. And as the current outbreak spreads, infected people could spread the disease further by preparing food without proper hygiene, the CDC reported. \"The way to prevent acquiring cholera when sanitation is poor is to take your water from a clean water source or treat water yourself in the home, and use good sanitary practices with clean water when preparing and cooking food,\" Tappero said. CNN's Miriam Falco and Matt Smith contributed to this report.",

During the past eight months the 43-year-old has sailed around the world twice and during a life of exploration, often living on the edge of survival, he has trekked to both poles, sailed solo across oceans and walked across almost every continent. The challenge for Horn now is to find the challenge. Even his first trek to the South Pole earlier this year, a dream he'd had childhood, left him underwhelmed. \"I think it was just an overrated experience,\" he told CNN. \"You were walking to civilization, away from the edge of Antarctica, which is completely wild, to the pole where there's an American base, airplanes landing everyday, red lights telling you if you can cross the runway or not. If I can't satisfy myself walking to the pole and back, let's try and do something else.\" That something else is pursuing a different type of adventure: motivating a new generation to take action to conserve the planet in the face of climate change. Using a specially designed and made 35-meter exploration boat called Pangaea, Horn is showing a lucky few parts of the world unreachable to most. Nearly a year into the four-year Pangaea Expedition, he's been more than encouraged by what he's seen in his \"young explorers\" selected from across the world. \"I haven't been disappointed by one of them. They're not polluted by politics or money. I'm not changing their lives, they're changing them themselves. I'm just taking them to somewhere it's nearly impossible for them to go without the boat, infrastructure and my knowledge,\" he said. It's a knowledge he said he has gained through hard experience; he lost the tips of fingers to frost bite in the Arctic and claims to have narrowly avoided execution at the hands of militia in DR Congo. His desire to preserve nature in a changing world stems from his respect for it. \"To come back alive [from an expedition], you haven't conquered nature, you've just managed to live in harmony with it. That is true competition to me. There's no start or end to it. Adventure becomes a way of living, an inner search of your knowledge,\" he said.  View the gallery of Mike Horn's adventures » . Spirit for adventure . Horn's adventurous spirit manifested itself early. Growing up in South Africa he was given his first bike at age 8 and set off to visit his uncle, not the one 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) away, but the one nearly 300 kilometers away. While his parents encouraged him to explore, a degree in Human Movement Science and honors degree in marketing gave him a greater of a sense of the psychology of competition. Time with the South African military's Special Forces fighting in Angola gave him a harsh lesson in survival and the difference between life and death. And a wife and two children who live in Switzerland remind him not to push it too far on his solo expeditions. Now when choosing the teenagers and young adults to join his expeditions he looks for things in them he saw in himself at that age; a curiosity and enthusiasm similar to his own and that continues to keep him motivated every day. Lecturers join Pangaea's voyages to add some scientific knowledge to Horn's first-hand understanding of the world, and there are ongoing projects for the young explorers to pursue when their time on the boat is over. Yet it is action, not words, that defines Horn. \"I think it's time to act more than anything else. Why discuss global warming and what are we going to do, if we can basically go out and do it?\" he said. \"I don't believe in global warming as such, I believe more in the climate and seasons changing. I'm not a specialist, I'm an adventurer, but maybe I've seen things that other people haven't seen that leads to what I think is a change in climate,\" he said . \"On the North Pole where before there was three to four meters of ice, today the ice breaks up, seals come through and polar bears can hunt there. When you see the big ice shelves break off around Antarctica, you think that there is something happening. I just talk about what I see.\" Action, not words . He's criticized the United Nations as a talking shop and says he has rebuffed advances to become affiliated with them, but has some plans to work with environmental groups, such as the World Wildlife Fund in Indonesia, in the near future. \"Politics slows down a lot. Everyone should have the freedom of speech and with organizations usually you have to keep to the protocol, but there's no protocol when it comes to the world and the future of the planet,\" he said. He's equally tired of adventures or projects that just raise awareness of climate change. \"We have to have a different approach, not that the one I have is completely right, but an approach where you have to build a boat out of plastic bottles... is that something we really must do? It's not enough to just take water samples and say the planet is warming up, or say there is plastic floating in the oceans,\" he said. \"Pangaea\" has some eco-friendly elements. As well as being able to go almost anywhere in the world's oceans, it is made from aluminum, since it is the most recyclable metal and is unpainted to reduce pollution from noxious paints usually found on ships. Part powered by solar, the crew is able to make its own water onboard and there is a plastic compactor for all the trash the boat trawls out of the oceans. Horn's single-mindedness has also secured lucrative partnerships with some big-name brands that bankroll his missions. Mercedes Benz are contracted to change Pangaea's engines every year with the most efficient model; next year they will get one with zero CO2 emissions. \"It gives them something to work on and me an opportunity to stay with my philosophy. There are some [companies] that don't give a s**t; you mustn't preach to the converted. That's why it's important to get companies involved that might change their mindset.\" Horn is positive that he can make a difference through educating his young charges and the problems many fear are impossible to solve, can be dealt with. \"I came back after the expedition around the Arctic and the North Pole and I saw 'An Inconvenient Truth' and I thought, 'It's not that bad.' The world is still a beautiful place. Let's conserve that beauty and teach [the younger generation] how to conserve it.\"",

         "(CNN) -- Mexican migration to the United States may have stalled, as a new study shows, but the political and social debates over immigrants living in the United States aren't going anywhere, experts say. The immigration debate is reflected in a number of policies and proposals, most recognizably state immigration laws that are being challenged. Oral arguments are scheduled at the Supreme Court on Wednesday as the justices decide whether Arizona can enforce its controversial immigration law. A bill in Mississippi that would require police to check the immigration status of all those arrested died in the state Senate this month. Amid the backdrop of contentious debates comes a study this week from the Pew Hispanic Center, which finds that for the first time in decades, the flow of Mexican migrants to and from the United States balances out. The effect may be even more pronounced. According to the report, \"the trend lines ... suggest that return flow to Mexico probably exceeded the inflow from Mexico during the past year or two.\" \"The largest wave of immigration in history from a single country to the United States has come to a standstill,\" the report announces. The report's findings weren't a surprise to several Mexican immigrants in Los Angeles, who said they've seen the political and economic situation shift dramatically in recent years. \"It isn't like it was before. The laws have changed. The work is very hard. Life is very expensive,\" said Norma Ibarra. \"It's not the United States it was 30 years ago.\" Alba Roche said her nieces in Mexico want to come to the United States, but can't. \"They haven't been able to come because of the situation, because there is not enough work, and more than anything because crossing is quite dangerous, so there are many obstacles,\" she said. Those who study immigration trends and policy agree that the apparent standstill in immigration is significant, but to varying degrees they say it will do little to change attitudes and actions in the United States. Jeffrey Passel, senior demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center and one of the report's authors, said that as Mexican families have fewer children, the number of potential immigrants is shrinking. Also, the Mexican economy is improving and providing jobs that before weren't available and provided a push to look for opportunities in the United States. \"It's likely impossible that we'll get back to the level of immigration that we saw 10 years ago. It's possible that the flows may pick up, but I don't think they will get anywhere near where they were in 2000,\" Passel said. \"People have been talking about the return flow for a couple of years, but it just wasn't showing up in the data, and now we're beginning to see it,\" he added. But the forces that pull immigrants to the United States and push them from Mexico have not disappeared. \"It's a little premature to say that part of history is over,\" said Tamar Jacoby, president and CEO of ImmigrationWorks USA, a federation of small-business owners in favor of immigration reform. There are a number of factors that may have affected the recent trend: better enforcement in the United States, demographic changes in Mexico and the economic downturn in the United States. \"We have three different reasons, and we don't know how important each one of these reasons is,\" she said. As those factors shift -- for example, as the U.S. economy improves -- the demand for immigrant workers in the United States will rise, she said. An improving situation in Mexico could result in fewer Mexicans migrating to the United States, but people from Central American countries could fill that void. Even if not as large as before, a future demand for immigrants in the United States will mean a continuation of the debates of today. The news produced in the Pew Hispanic report may relieve some people's anxieties, but for many illegal immigration critics, the real problem isn't the immigrants arriving today but the cumulative effects of immigrants who have arrived illegally over the past 30 years, Jacoby said. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, said there is no question that immigration from Mexico has slowed, but it doesn't mean nobody is coming. \"The claim that this is a permanent development is premature,\" said Krikorian, whose center favors a restrictive approach to immigration policy. \"When our economy picks up, what happens then?\" he asked. Krikorian said he sees the pause in Mexican migration as an opportunity to build up enforcement against future illegal immigration. \"The conclusion I draw from this is that we have breathing space to put enforcement measures in place that we will need when these pressures mount again,\" he said.

         "(CNN) -- It was the first house she looked at upon arriving in the small town in central Italy that would be her home for a semester abroad. But Amanda Knox immediately knew it was the one for her. The University of Washington student had been in Perugia for just a few hours on a hot summer day in 2007 with her younger sister, Deanna, who saw a poster that included the word \"appartamento.\" They followed the girl who had posted the ad to a charming, four-bedroom villa near the University for Foreigners of Perugia overlooking a small valley where figs grew. The sisters chatted for hours in the kitchen with the two friendly Italian girls who lived there and made plans with them to tour the town the next day. To the wanderlust-driven young American, who had been hitting the books hard and working multiple jobs since high school so she could study abroad, it was a dream come true. \"She didn't need to see any other place, she didn't need to see any other listings, she was set,\" says her sister. British exchange student Meredith Kercher moved into the house shortly after Knox settled in. The two foreigners became fast friends, Knox's friends and family say, as they explored Perugia together. None of them had any way of knowing that just weeks later, the home would be the scene of a grisly stabbing that would leave Kercher dead and Knox branded her cold-blooded killer. Prosecutors in Perugia said Knox directed then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito and another man infatuated with her, Rudy Guede, to hold Kercher down as Knox played with a knife before slashing Kercher's throat. Knox and Sollecito were convicted in 2009. Knox was sentenced to 26 years in prison and Sollecito is serving a 25-year sentence. Guede, a drifter originally from the Ivory Coast, was tried separately and is serving a 16-year sentence. Knox and Sollecito are awaiting a ruling on their appeal against conviction. Media paints two portraits of Knox . The sordid saga has played out in worldwide media long enough to have broken into dual narratives. Some journalists have portrayed Knox as an overly trusting college student who some believe was railroaded by the Italian justice system. Other media paint her as a licentious, manipulative young American still trying to get away with murder, despite an alleged confession, which she quickly recanted, and a conviction. To Knox's friends and family, it's a no-brainer. They grimace at the description prosecutors painted of Knox as a resentful American so angry with Kercher that she exacted revenge during a twisted sexual misadventure. Nothing in her past indicated she had the desire or capacity to kill anyone, let alone a friend, they say. One friend told CNN she was the kind of person who would pick up a spider and take it outside rather than kill it. More than anything, they say, her life had been all about immersing herself in new experiences and creating opportunities to travel abroad. Easy daughter . Growing up in Seattle, Washington, Knox was an easy daughter from the start, says Edda Mellas, Knox's mother. She was a child who never had to be told to do her homework or go to bed on time. She maintained a balance between a life indoors, where she studied regularly and read for pleasure, and a passion for outdoor activities and sports, in particular gymnastics and soccer. Knox's desire to study foreign languages and experience different cultures also became apparent early on, Mellas says. She took Latin in middle school and began expressing a desire to travel abroad. Even though her parents told her they couldn't afford a private high school, she applied on her own and was accepted with a substantial scholarship. She learned Japanese in high school and spent time in Japan as part of her studies, her mother says. \"She loved learning languages. She thought about being an interpreter. She really wanted to be a writer and I said, 'Maybe you need to get a day job while you're trying to make money being a writer.' And then she thought about being an interpreter. Languages were definitely her kind of gift.\" In 2004, her mother took her daughters to Europe. They visited family in Austria and spent Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany. \"They just loved seeing the history and the culture and differences in people. And it was a great experience,\" Mellas said. Knox eventually turned her sights to studying abroad in college. She rejected soccer scholarships from several schools because she knew she would have to commit to the sports program. So again, she set her sights on a longshot: the highly competitive University of Washington. She got in and made a positive first impression on practically everyone she met, says friend Andrew Seliber, who testified at her trial as a character witness. \"I think it was her just open personality to, you know, see the good things in people and have always a positive attitude about everybody and everything in the world.  And it was really refreshing coming to school and meeting people like that, especially like her, who were, you know, so willing to see everybody's perspectives about, you know, anything.\" Seliber adds she worked hard to keep up her GPA, making the dean's list almost every quarter, so she could travel her junior year. \"I think (studying abroad) was kind of an extension of that personality where she always wanted to meet people and -- and just get their perspectives on the world, because there's really no better way of opening yourself up than to travel the world,\" Seliber says. She considered Germany, Austria and Scotland, her mother says, before deciding on Italy, a place she'd never been and where the people spoke a language she hadn't studied. \"She wanted to try something different,\" Mellas says. \"Once she decided on Italy, she thought about going to the really typical places: Florence or Rome. But she really thought that to her seemed more touristy. And she wanted just everyday, small-town, regular Italians and not where there would be hundreds of English-speaking people. She wanted to immerse herself in a smaller town and -- she looked around and Perugia had a program.\" Mellas worried about her but took comfort in the fact that she would be close to relatives in Europe. \"You worry if you send your kids that far away. But it was also a dream of hers that you know, nobody was going to squash. I worried that she was too trusting. I worried that she didn't have enough self-preservation kind of instincts.\" European adventure . Knox worked in two coffee shops and an art gallery, living frugally to save the $10,000 she would need for the trip. Finally, the time arrived for her to begin her adventure in August 2007. She and her sister went to Europe to visit relatives before catching a train to Perugia. From the start, it was an adventure, her sister says. \"We showed up in Perugia on the train and just thought we could find our way to her hotel, and realized that we had no idea where we were going. So we ended up hiking with our backpacks like, five miles right off the train station to even find a bus that would take us to our hotel,\" Deanna Knox says. As soon as they arrived, Knox made her way to the University for Foreigners of Perugia to get the lay of the land. \"The city was really beautiful. You could really tell on Amanda's face and how she was acting that she was instantly in love.\" After school began, Knox sent enthusiastic e-mails to her family nearly every day. She described attending a chocolate festival and a book fair with Kercher. A few weeks into her stay, she wrote in various e-mails that she had met a handsome computer engineering student who looked like Harry Potter at a classical music concert. Knox had been a \"late bloomer\" in terms of dating, so news that she had met Raffaele Sollecito made her sister happy. \"She was just infatuated with the whole idea of him. First of all, he was a foreign guy, he was sweet, he was really kind, he was smart. ... He was exactly my sister's type.\" Deanna Knox says. \"It was pretty exciting. I wanted to learn more about him, and it just happened that they were only dating for two weeks before everything happened. I wish -- I really wish that they could've gotten to know each other a lot better.\" CNN's Mallory Simon and Todd Schwarzschild contributed to this report.",

         "DECATUR, Georgia (CNN) -- Police quietly wait by the front door of the small, brick suburban Atlanta home as investigators tell 48-year-old Lajuana Robinson, a mother of nine, \"I'm going to have to put you in handcuffs.\" Investigators take a woman from her Decatur, Georgia, home after her arrest in a truancy case. She's charged with violating her parole in a truancy case because three of her younger children have missed hundreds of days of school combined. While students have always suffered the consequences of playing hooky, parents in DeKalb County, Georgia, are facing one of the more aggressive anti-truancy programs in the country, one where punishment can include time behind bars. DeKalb's program is one of a growing list targeting truancy in U.S. schools, said Jodi Heilbrunn, senior research and policy analyst at The National Center for School Engagement. \"Ten years ago, there weren't too many anti-truancy programs, but now they are springing up like rabbits,\" Heilbrunn said, and \"they come in many varieties.\" In some communities, a single school takes on its own problem. In others, like Jacksonville, Florida, and Niagara Falls, New York, the battle is system wide. And New Jersey is about to institute a statewide system, targeting six cities with the worst truancy problems. The DeKalb County program, started in May 2006, was designed to get children from the age of 6 to 16 back in class. If a child has 10 or more unexcused absences from school, parents are referred to an intervention program where they sign a contract agreeing to make sure their children get to class. If they fail to do that, they face the judge. According the county solicitor general's office, around 300 families have gone to court so far.  Watch how a Georgia mother ends up in handcuffs » . Most of the parents who are cited are charged with educational neglect, said DeKalb County Solicitor-General Robert James. Most of those charged plead guilty and get probation, he said. The probation usually involves parenting classes, counseling, and follow-up visits for progress and attendance reports. Parents who violate their probation run the risk of thousands of dollars in fines, and up to 30 days in jail per count. \"We are putting parents in jail, or we are bringing them in orange jumpsuits not just because their children are not in school, but because they got a subpoena or summons to come to court, or to come to a diversionary program and they refused to do so. So this is more about accountability than anything,\" James said. James said it is critical in his county to keep kids in school. The Georgia Department of Corrections found that more than 60 percent of its inmates in 2007 didn't earn a high school diploma, and James quoted an internal survey that found 84 percent of inmates in DeKalb County's jail are high school dropouts. LaTara Tankersley-Jones and Craig Scott, investigators for the DeKalb County Solicitor-General's office, are tasked with locating \"truant\" parents and serving court-ordered summons. Jones and Scott, usually with assistance from local law enforcement, also must arrest parents who have not complied with a court-ordered probation or failed to show up to court in the first place. Scott said arrest is the least desirable option, but \"the bottom line is, we have a warrant and even if the children are there, you're going to have to come with us.\" Robinson was no stranger to the investigators. The county had intervened on behalf of her children before, even providing Thanksgiving dinner and Christmas presents last year. The mother had been ordered to be sure her children went to school and to attend parenting classes herself. She had done neither, investigators said, earning herself a night in jail and a face-to-face with the judge the next day. Judge R. Joy Walker presides over the Educational Neglect courtroom. On a recent Friday in October, she handled each of the 80 or so cases before her in a fast, firm, and efficient manner. One by one, each parent, mostly women, has an opportunity to explain to Walker why they are in her courtroom. Investigators Jones and Scott are there as well. They say they hear the same excuses over and over again. \"They can't get up, or they have so many things that are going on in their life that are preventing them from making sure that their kids go to school,\" Jones said. Walker agrees to probation for most of the parents in her court this day, including Angela Harris, who pleads guilty to 24 counts, one for each of the 24 days her child missed school. \"I have never in my 48 years been in trouble, so this is all new to me,\" she tells the judge. \"The state is offering you 24 months (of probation), but if you mess up I'm going to put you in jail,\" Walker replies. Walker has put 15 \"truant\" parents behind bars. Lajuana Robinson is released. But she'll have to return to court another day to explain why her children aren't in school. So far, the success of the DeKalb program has been limited. \"We have seen some small results,\" James said. Attendance has increased by 2 to 3 percent over the past year. \"I am not satisfied by that, but in a school system of over 100,000 kids, you are talking about 2,000  to 3,000 more children attending school than what we had the year before last,\" he said. James says that he has received some interest from neighboring counties about the program and he thinks it is only a matter of time before they adopt similar ones. \"We have a lot of parents who feel we should not be intervening in family business, but it's the law. In Georgia, in DeKalb County, attendance is the law, and we plan to enforce it.\"",

         "Washington (CNN) -- The Senate on Thursday passed a giant defense bill that includes a new policy for detaining and trying suspected al Qaeda terrorists -- a policy that attracted controversy during the debate and may draw a presidential veto. The defense authorization bill passed by a vote of 93-7. In keeping with budget cuts across the government, the $662 billion bill shrinks Pentagon spending by $43 billion from last year. It includes funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and sets policies for the various weapons systems and personnel programs at the Defense Department. Senate debate on the detainee matter was at times volatile and emotional. After years of struggling with issues of who should investigate, detain and try suspected terrorists -- civilian authorities and courts or the military and its tribunal system -- Armed Services Committee Chair Carl Levin, D-Michigan, and ranking Republican John McCain of Arizona reached a long-sought compromise to codify the process. However, critics complained the deal was weighted toward the military because it required any suspected al Qaeda terrorists, even those captured inside the U.S., to be held potentially indefinitely by the military. That concerned the White House and many lawmakers who think the responsibility belongs, in part, to law enforcement agencies and the federal courts and warned that Americans could possibly be detained indefinitely by the military. Levin and McCain denied their bill would allow for the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens. \"This country is special because we have certain values, and due process of law is one of those values,\" Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, D-California, argued on the Senate floor. \"I object to holding American citizens without trial. I do not believe that makes us more safe.\" \"You have people on the left who hate saying 'the war on terror,'\" responded Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina. \"They would never ever use the military and always insist the law enforcement be used because they don't buy into the idea that we're at war. They want to criminalize the war.\" Senators ultimately reached an agreement to amend the bill to make clear it's not the bill's intent to allow for the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens and others legally residing in the country. \"It would provide the assurance that we are not adversely affecting the rights of American citizens in this language,\" Levin said while expressing support for the compromise. \"It supports present law,\" Feinstein added. Senators from both parties also challenged the Obama administration's policies toward Iran, unanimously approving an amendment insisting on tough new sanctions against Iran's Central Bank and entities that do business with it. Senators want to punish Iran over its pursuit of a nuclear weapons programs and the recent storming of the British Embassy in Tehran. The administration complained the Senate amendment would make it difficult for the White House to manage a delicate foreign policy matter. Also Thursday, the Senate approved on a voice vote a Democratic amendment requiring President Barack Obama to develop a plan to expedite the troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, which is scheduled to be completed in 2014. While it's not clear the amendment will force any actual acceleration of the withdrawal, Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, said the Senate vote was a \"message\" to the president that U.S. troops have successfully performed their mission of stamping out al Qaeda and the 9-11 terrorists and \"it's time to bring our men and women home.\" The measure still needs to go to conference for reconciliation with the House version of the bill.",

         "Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- A top Lebanese intelligence official was on his way to discuss a recent threat allegedly linked to Syria when he was assassinated last week, a lawmaker told CNN on Monday. A car bomb killed Brig. Gen. Wissam al-Hassan and two others Friday, 30 minutes before he was to meet with Lebanese lawmaker Amar Houri to discuss a threatening text message sent to the lawmaker from a Syrian phone number, according to parliamentarian Ahmad Fatfat. Similar threats had been sent via text message to three other lawmakers, including Fatfat, although they did not realize it until after al-Hassan's assassination, Fatfat said. All four are members of Lebanon's Future Movement, the largest member of the vocally anti-Syrian March 14 political coalition led by Saad Hariri. After al-Hassan's assassination, Fatfat said he and his colleagues received another text from a similar phone number threatening further killings: \"Congratulations, the countdown has started,\" the text read. \"One of ten.\" Al-Hassan, who was killed along with a bodyguard and a bystander, was an icon among many fellow Sunni Muslims -- including those aligned with Hariri's opposition coalition -- for his leadership and efforts in rooting out those responsible for targeted killings in Lebanon. But as much as he was loved by some, he angered others -- especially those backing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and many affiliated with Hezbollah, the Shiite militant and political movement that has a prominent role in Lebanon's government. The U.S. government labels it a terrorist organization. However, Hezbollah is widely popular with many of Lebanon's Shiite Muslims. Al-Hassan: A polarizing figure . The lawmakers had told al-Hassan about the threatening texts they had received before Friday's attack, and al-Hassan had agreed to meet with one of them Friday to discuss the details. U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Monday that an FBI team will be sent to Lebanon to assist in the investigation into al-Hassan's death. Since the assassination, sporadic fighting has erupted across Lebanon, threatening to plunge the country into chaos and raising fears that it could be drawn into the bloody 19-month-old civil war in neighboring Syria. After al-Hassan's funeral Sunday, angry protesters clashed with security forces and rushed toward the prime minister's office, calling for his dismissal. By midday Monday, at least three people had been killed in the northern city of Tripoli, while another person was killed in the southern city of Sidon, and another killed in Beirut, Lebanon's official National News Agency reported. More than two dozen people were injured nationwide. Amid the unrest, the youth wing of the March 14 coalition called for a peaceful rally in Beirut's Martyrs' Square on Monday evening. The March 14 movement is an anti-Syrian coalition that emerged after the 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. His son, Saad, leads the coalition. Key players in Lebanon's latest crisis . Syria has condemned the attack but that hasn't stopped accusations it is behind Friday's killing, which marked the country's highest-profile assassination in more than seven years. The United States has also condemned the attack and vowed to assist in investigating the bombing. CNN's Saad Abedine contributed to this report.",

         "(CNN) -- A number of Chipotle employees across Minnesota were fired after an immigration audit targeted the restaurant chain for allegedly hiring undocumented workers, officials said. \"We are not disclosing a number of people displaced by this,\" company spokesman Chris Arnold said Monday. \"We did lose some restaurant employees in Minnesota following a document review by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\" The review took place last month and is likely reflective of a shift away from work-site crackdowns against employees -- considered a hallmark practice under the Bush administration -- and toward so-called \"I-9 audits,\" which instead focus on the hiring practices of their employers, according to analysts and a U.S. Immigration official who declined to be named. The I-9 form is an employment eligibility document meant to determine a person's ability to work legally in the United States. \"At the end of the day, the goal is to ensure that the companies have an authorized, legal workforce and also that employers are aware of their responsibility to ensure the people they hire are lawful,\" the official said. The I-9 strategy is believed to be a more effective use of the agency's investigative resources, putting the onus on the audited company to take corrective action, the official added. Chipotle has \"done what ICE has asked of us and are looking to put that incident behind us,\" Arnold said. The crackdown coincides with recent judiciary hearings in Arizona in which lawmakers debated proposals to end birthright citizenship for U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants. Nearly one-third of America's 38 million immigrants are illegal, just under four percent of the total U.S. population, according to recent reports from the Pew Hispanic Research Center and the Brookings Institute, a Washington-based think tank. Of those, many are employed in low-wage restaurants jobs. But analysts debate the broader economic impact of illegal immigration in the United States. Critics often blame the large undocumented workforce for siphoning public resources while forcing a drop in wages or displacing low-skilled U.S.-born workers. Advocates say consumers benefit from lower prices as a result of the lower wages paid to illegal workers, arguing that they fill unskilled labor gaps and create work opportunities for higher-skilled, higher-paid workers who are often native born. Illegal immigration \"nationally, doesn't seem to make a significant difference\" to the broader U.S. economy, said Audrey Singer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute who studies U.S. immigration policy. \"The real impact is at local levels,\" Singer said, pointing to state and local law enforcement, schools and health care systems that pay for an undocumented workforce that may or may not contribute tax revenue for services rendered. But as record unemployment rates affect cities and towns across the country, immigrants -- particularly illegal immigrants -- are being targeted, she said.

         "(CNN) -- Dubai is home to the tallest building, largest mall and biggest candy shop. Recently, however, the city proved that its penchant for the extra large isn't limited to the inanimate. Last week, the Dubai Mall became home to a giant pacific octopus -- the largest species of octopus on the planet. The newest occupant, who lives at the mall's Dubai Aquarium & Underwater Zoo, stretches out to a fear-inducing 14 feet, and weighs over 70 kilograms (154 pounds). Earlier this month, the aquarium announced it had acquired one of the largest known reptiles on the planet, a 1,600-pound crocodile they've dubbed King Croc (they also flew in his companion, Queen Croc). John Gerner, a theme park consultant and the managing director at Leisure Business Advisors, notes that the mall's current preoccupation with large animals is consistent with the Emirate's obsession with record-breaking pursuits. \"In a general, entertainment attractions have always been a way for countries to have bragging rights in the world. By having the best, the biggest and the fastest of everything, Dubai wants to show they've arrived on the world stage. In many ways, having record-breaking animals is another way to do that,\" he says. The country is no stranger to peppering its entertainment offerings with animals exotic to the region. In 2012, Ski Dubai -- the indoor ski slope housed at Mall of the Emirates -- welcomed a colony of King and Gentoo penguins. In 2008, Atlantis, The Palm hotel courted controversy from animal rights groups when it hosted a whale shark in its in-built aquarium. \"Lately, you're seeing attractions where you wouldn't typically find animals adding them in. It's a merging of concepts. At Atlantis, you have a lodging using an animal attraction as an amenity to justify higher room rates and occupancy,\" explains Gerner. It's a concept that doesn't sit well with local animal rights groups. \"In the wild, crocodiles spent hours swimming and can regulate the buoyancy and temperature or their bodies. No enclosure -- no matter how large -- is able to provide crocodiles with everything that is natural and important to them,\" says Ashley Fruno, the Asia and Middle East senior campaigner for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). \"If the Dubai Mall wants to set itself apart from the rest, there are other ways to do that than imprisoning wild animals in concrete enclosures and taking away everything that is natural and important to them,\" she adds. In a statement, Emaar, the developers for The Dubai Mall, note that King Croc and his companion were obtained from a crocodile farm in Australia. They add that the transfer was facilitated in partnership with Australian government authorities, who reviewed the quality of the display, qualifications of the staff caring for the animals and the educational purpose of the exhibit. Emaar also notes that the habitat made for the two crocodiles is three times the size specified by the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums. The country's fascination with wild animals isn't always limited to the indoors. Last year the UAE's Ministry of Environment and Water issued bans on the commercial and personal import of a variety of exotic animals -- including many big cats and primates -- yet they remain popular pets for many Emiratis, who see them as a status symbol. Several locals have shot to Instagram fame showcasing their exotic animal collection. \"Unfortunately, the trade in exotic animals is largely unregulated and statistics are very difficult to come by,\" says Fruno. \"The animals pay the price for this trade. Many don't survive the journey from their homes in the wild, and those that do often die prematurely from malnutrition, an unnatural environment, loneliness and the overwhelming stress of confinement.\" Still, she does note that animal rights -- though a newer concept in the UAE -- is on the rise. \"Awareness is growing by the day, and new animal welfare groups are popping up in the region all the time,\" she says.",

         "New York (CNN) -- Evelyn Lauder, a member of the Estee Lauder cosmetic company who helped create the pink ribbon symbol for breast cancer awareness, died Saturday in New York City. She was 75. Lauder died from complications of ovarian cancer at her home with her family by her side, the company said. The Vienna, Austria, native fled Nazi-occupied Europe with her parents, eventually settling in New York City. As a college freshman, she was introduced to the man she would marry, Leonard A. Lauder, the son of Estee and Joseph Lauder, who co-founded the cosmetics company. Lauder joined the family business and rose to be senior corporate vice president and head of fragrance development worldwide. Perhaps best known as an advocate for women's health, Lauder helped to create the pink ribbon, the now ubiquitous symbol for breast cancer awareness. She is survived by her husband, two sons and five grandchildren. \"My mother carried the torch of our company heritage and the values that were passed to her by my grandmother, Mrs. Estee Lauder,\" her son, William Lauder, said in a statement. \"My mother and father were life partners as well as business partners. They nurtured the culture and growth of the Estee Lauder companies, and as we grew, my mother was our creative compass and pillar of strength.

         "(CNN) -- iTunes? Old news. Radio? Ancient history. Buying a new CD? Maybe every now and then. But the most popular way today's teens discover music is through clicking around on YouTube. That's the finding of a new study by media research firm Nielsen. Its Music 360 report set out to learn how music is found, purchased and consumed. Among all adults, radio remains the most popular tool, with 48 percent saying that's how they usually discover their new jams. Young listeners opting to stream, not own music . But more teens, 64 percent, cited YouTube, the Web's leading video-sharing site, as a place where they listen to music. Followed by radio (56%), iTunes (53% ) and CDs (50%). The popularity of YouTube is dramatically higher among teens than all adults. Only 7 percent of all respondents said they discover music most frequently through the site. Strangely, the report doesn't address teens' listening habits on music-streaming sites such as Pandora, Spotify or Grooveshark. \"The accessibility of music has seen tremendous expansion and diversification,\" said David Bakula, a Nielsen senior vice president. \"While younger listeners opt for technologically advanced methods , traditional methods of discovery like radio and word-of-mouth continue to be strong drivers.\" The study also shows the changing landscape of music sales. Just over one in three teens (36 percent) said they'd bought a CD in the past year, while more than half (51 percent) said they'd paid to download at least one song. The report came from an online survey of 3,000 people in the United States. Among all respondents, finding new music still relies upon a mix of new media and more traditional means. In addition to the 48 percent who favor radio, 10 percent said they rely on friends or relatives for suggestions. But more than half (54 percent) said those personal recommendations make them more likely to make a purchase. YouTube, which is owned by Google, claims more than 800 million unique visitors every month. More than 3 billion hours of videos are viewed each month and 72 hours worth of video are uploaded every minute, according to the site. Streaming debate strikes chord with music fans .

         "(CNN)  -- Forget World Cups. For many rugby union players the ultimate accomplishment is being selected to appear for the famed British Lions on their overseas tours. Giant Munster lock Paul O'Connell is leading the 2009 Lions in South Africa. The Lions are comprised of the best players from the four home unions of England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland and competition for places in the squad is fierce as club and country loyalties are put aside. In the modern professional era, Lions tours take place every four years, visiting the southern-hemisphere Tri-Nations powers of New Zealand, South Africa and Australia in rotation. A typical tour will see a series of matches against provincial or regional sides, interspersed with international or Test matches. Midweek fixtures are normally against weaker teams, with the Lions giving all their squad members a chance to play, with stronger opposition for the weekend matches which would include the Tests. The 2009 Lions are touring world champions South Africa, looking to improve on the dismal performance of the 2005 side, which visited New Zealand. Under England's 2003 World Cup winning coach Clive Woodward, the 2005 squad were expected to prosper, but slipped to defeat in all three Test matches against the All Blacks. The team was captained by Brian O'Driscoll, but his tour ended after just two minutes of the first Test when he was controversially 'spear' tackled by Tana Umaga and Keven Mealamu and dislocated his shoulder. O'Driscoll, who led Ireland to the Six Nations Grand Slam this year, was expected to captain the Lions to South Africa, but coach Ian McGeechan gave the job to Munster lock Paul O'Connell. McGeechan has already gone into Lions history, playing on the 1974 and 1977 tours, and coaching winning teams to Australia and South Africa in 1989 and 1997. He also took them to New Zealand in 1993 where the Test series was lost 2-1. The Lions enjoyed their most successful period in the early 1970s with the 1971 team -- inspired by the Welsh half-back pairing of Gareth Edwards and Barry John -- triumphing against the All Blacks in New Zealand. The 1974 Lions were arguably the best-known and most successful of all time, winning three Tests and drawing one in South Africa and going through the tour unbeaten. Under Irish captain Willie John McBride, their uncompromising forward play set up the victories, with their now infamous catch phrase \"get your retaliation in first\" leading to brutal early exchanges in most games. The modern era is a far cry from the first Lions tour back in 1888 which visited Australia and New Zealand with just 21 players from England, Scotland and Wales. They played provincial and local sides without formal Test matches. But it had established a precedent, and the 1891 side was sanctioned by the sport's ruling body the Rugby Football Union (RFU) and played three Tests against South Africa. The 1924 tour to South Africa was the first trip when the term \"the Lions\" became common currency and it has grown from strength to strength since, despite the growing influence of international rugby competitions such as the Tri and Six Nations and the World Cup.",

         "(CNN) -- Pakistani Taliban leader Qari Hussain Mehsud, whose notoriety includes allegedly recruiting children as suicide bombers, is being targeted by the United States, the State Department announced Thursday. \"Widely considered to be the deadliest of all TTP's commanders, Hussain and the TTP (Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan) have taken responsibility for many lethal suicide bombings throughout Pakistan,\" the State Department said in a news release on Qari Hussain. The released cited a string of such attacks, including a blast last September that killed at least 54 people at a rally in Quetta and a car bombing the same month that killed at least 17 people -- including four children -- in Lakki Marwat. Even among militant groups known for brutal violence, Qari Hussain Mehsud has a notorious reputation. He is alleged to have recruited dozens of Pakistani children as suicide bombers (a form of attack in which he reportedly is an expert trainer) and has boasted of personally beheading enemies. After the abortive Times Square bombing in New York last year, his voice was purportedly on the audio tape that claimed responsibility for the attack on behalf of the TTP. On several occasions, Pakistani officials have claimed that he has been killed. No evidence has ever been presented, and it seems that Qari Hussain is still somewhere in the rugged mountains along the Afghan-Pakistan border -- most likely in North Waziristan. He is well connected in jihadist circles. He is a cousin of the current leader of the TTP, Hakimullah Mehsud (himself a target of US drone attacks), and terrorism analysts believe he has good contacts with other groups active in the region. Not that those contacts have always been cordial -- Pakistani media reported in 2008 a feud over the fate of a Polish geologist who was being held by Qari Hussain's group. Rather than hand him over to another faction, they slit his throat. Qari Hussein comes from the Mehsud tribe, which is prominent in Waziristan and includes several other leading figures in the Pakistan Taliban. But he also spent time as a boy in Karachi, attending a hard-line Sunni \"madrassa\" or religious school. A Pakistani journalist, Tahir Ali, wrote last year of a meeting with Qari Hussain, who claimed to have been active in militant groups since boyhood. Ali quoted him as saying: \"I was very young when I joined Lashkar i Jhangvi and actively took part in anti-Shia activities; I also remained for a short time with Ilyas Kashmiri group ... later on I focused on jihad in Waziristan.\" Both Lashkar and the Ilyas Kashmiri group are militant anti-Shia groups involved in terrorism in Pakistan and Indian Kashmir. Ilyas Kashmiri has repeatedly threatened to export terror attacks to Europe. According to Ali, he also claimed to be just 22 years of age. Others who have met him say that Qari Hussein appears to be in his early 40s. In January 2008, the Pakistani army launched \"Operation Zalzala\" against a Mehsud stronghold in South Waziristan. While many Taliban fighters were killed and his house was destroyed, Qari Hussain escaped. But Pakistani forces uncovered a \"school\" that he is said to have run for child suicide bombers, along with videos of classes. Pakistani Maj. Gen. Tariq Khan described the school as \"like a factory\" which had been turning 9- to 12-year old boys into suicide bombers. The U.S. State Department's designation of Qari Hussain Hussain says he \"has gained particular notoriety for his heavy recruitment of children.\" Undaunted, Qari Hussain shifted his operations to North Waziristan and later released a 40-minute video in which teenagers and young men declared their intent to become suicide bombers. By this time, he was the commander of Fidayeen-e-Islam, a group within the Pakistani Taliban that specialized in suicide bombings. These were aimed at the Pakistani state and military, and included attacks on federal and police offices in Lahore. But they were also aimed at Pakistan's Shia minority. A Shia procession in Lahore in September 2010 was attacked by a Taliban suicide bomber, who killed 33 people. The number of suicide attacks rose dramatically between 2007 and 2010, and most were blamed on or claimed by the Pakistani Taliban. It was in May 2010 that the Pakistan Taliban was linked to its first attempted attack in the U.S. Faisal Shahzad attempted to leave a car bomb in New York's Times Square. It failed to go off, but an audio tape released hours later purported to feature the voice of Qari Hussein in claiming that \"the recent attack\" was in response to American \"interference and terrorism in Muslim countries, especially in Pakistan.\" It's not known whether Qari Hussain met or trained Shahzad, but it seems likely that he was involved in the suicide bombing of the CIA base in Khost, Afghanistan, at the end of 2009. Before the attack, the suicide bomber recorded a video with Hakimullah Mehsud, and as the Pakistani Taliban's expert trainer of suicide bombers, Qari Hussain likely helped him prepare for the mission. In its designation, the U.S. State Department says \"Hussain is believed to have trained the Jordanian militant Humam Muhammad Abu Mulal al-Balawi\" who carried out the Khost attack, killing seven U.S. citizens. The Pakistani government has declared a reward of 50 million rupees ($600,000) for his capture, but Qari Hussain has evaded both capture and the much-expanded U.S. drone campaign. The U.S. action against Qari Hussain blocks all property \"subject to U.S. jurisdiction in which Hussain has an interest\" and prohibits all transactions by U.S. persons with Hussain. Given his record so far, it is unlikely to have much impact on his role within the Pakistani Taliban.",

         "(CNN)  -- Last year, the bus in which a young Congolese woman we met named Mary was riding was stopped by a militia. \"They wanted to all have me, to rape me,\" she related haltingly to us. \"I told them no, and then they took off my shirt and beat me. I have terrible marks now.\" Mary's story is similar to hundreds of thousands of women's experiences in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, where rape is routinely \"deployed\" as a weapon of war by the armed groups fighting over a nation that has some of the richest nonpetroleum natural resource deposits in the world. Congo holds the numbing distinction of being home to the deadliest war in the world since World War II -- with more than 5.4 million people killed during the past 15 years. \"This war is caused by the minerals,\" Mary told us. \"Those [armed groups] control the minerals. I hear that they are used in mobile phones. ... If you talk to Obama or the phone companies, tell them what happens here.\" Armed groups in eastern Congo that control minerals, mines and trading routes generate an estimated $180 million each year by trading four main minerals: tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold. This money enables the armed groups to purchase large numbers of weapons and continue their campaign of brutal violence against civilians. Conflict minerals are key components in the manufacture of cell phones, laptops, digital cameras, video games and portable music players. Because of increasing awareness of the links between electronics products and the worst sexual violence in the world, change is afoot. During U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's visit to eastern Congo in August, she said: \"With respect to companies that are responsible for what are now being called conflict minerals, I think the international community must start looking at steps we can take to try to prevent the mineral wealth from the DRC ending up in the hands of those who fund the violence here.\" The U.S. Congress has also initiated a strong bipartisan effort to curb the conflict minerals trade. Senate and House bills on this issue represent a significant step toward having conflict-free cell phones and laptops by setting up a system of audits and minerals-tracing mechanisms. This would reveal which phones and laptops contain conflict minerals and which ones do not. Introduced by Sens. Sam Brownback (R-Kansas), Russ Feingold (D-Wisconsin) and Dick Durbin (D-Illinois) on the Senate side, and Reps. Jim McDermott (D-Washington), Frank Wolf (R-Virginia), Barney Frank (D-Massachusetts) and Donald Payne (D-New Jersey) on the House side, the bills already have the support of powerful committee chairmen but still must be moved through committee. With the Obama administration and Congress taking a strong interest in this issue, and activist campaigning building some momentum, companies have begun to react. The tin industry has gone the furthest by introducing an initiative to increase due diligence and trace minerals on the ground in Congo. Electronics companies also have a project under way to map out supply chains. And Intel, HP, Dell, and Motorola are hosting a meeting with activists on conflict minerals in San Francisco, California, this month. But it is not enough. Campus activists -- from New York; to Knoxville, Tennessee; to Nevada -- are taking up this issue with increased vigor, along with major faith-based groups, from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops to Jewish World Watch. Are the government and company actions taken to date enough to stop the conflict minerals trade from continuing? The answer is no. Electronics companies must invest in a system to certify that the minerals used in their products are verifiably conflict-free. They must work with their suppliers to trace the minerals back to their mines of origin and have independent audits conducted of these supply chains so that we know with verified proof that none has passed through the hands of armed groups. The Obama administration should help companies develop a certification process for conflict minerals, built on the lessons of the Kimberley Process for blood diamonds. The administration can also help devise a public-private partnership to work with companies, the Congolese government and other key donor countries to help miners in eastern Congo and improve mining inspection and tracing on the ground. Companies and the government can take steps today. For a start, electronics companies should have audits conducted of their supply chains for the minerals. And Congress should pass the conflict minerals legislation, to get tracing started. If you have a cell phone, you can also have an impact. Ask your senator and representative to sign the Congo Conflict Minerals Act (S. 891) and Conflict Minerals Trade Act (H.R. 4128), and find a creative way to reach your cell phone manufacturer to tell it you want a conflict-free cell phone. The minerals supply chain involves multiple companies, and the war in Congo will not be resolved overnight. But if companies and consumers take a stand and say \"Give us conflict-free products,\" we can stop this deadly trade and put real pressure on the armed groups that rape women on a mass scale in eastern Congo. Let Mary's request not be forgotten. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sasha Lezhnev and John Prendergast.",

         "(CNN) -- We've finally emerged from the season in which Americans were asked by the pollsters and politicians: \"Are you better off today than you were four years ago?\" But sometimes it's important to contemplate the question of progress from a longer view: How are we doing on the scale of a generation? To answer that question, take this brief quiz. Over the past two decades, what have the U.S. trends been for the following important measures of social health: high school dropout rates, college enrollment, juvenile crime, drunken driving, traffic deaths, infant mortality, life expectancy, per capita gasoline consumption, workplace injuries, air pollution, divorce, male-female wage equality, charitable giving, voter turnout, per capita GDP and teen pregnancy? The answer for all of them is the same: The trend is positive. Almost all those varied metrics of social wellness have improved by more than 20% over the past two decades. And that's not counting the myriad small wonders of modern medicine that have improved our quality of life as well as our longevity: the anti-depressants and insulin pumps and quadruple bypasses. Americans enjoy longer, healthier lives in more stable families and communities than we did 20 years ago. But other than the crime trends, these facts are rarely reported or shared via word-of-mouth channels. Idea of American exceptionalism a powerful force through history . Many Americans, for instance, are convinced that \"half of all marriages end in divorce,\" though that hasn't been the case since the early 1980s, when divorce rates peaked at just over 50%. Since then, they have declined by almost a third. This is not merely a story of success in advanced industrial countries. The quality-of-life and civic health trends in the developing world are even more dramatic. Even though the world's population has doubled over the past 50 years, the percentage living in poverty has declined by 50% over that period. Infant mortality and life expectancy have improved by more than 40% in Latin America since the early 1990s. No country in history has improved its average standard of living faster than China has over the past two decades. Of course, not all the arrows point in a positive direction, particularly after the past few years. The number of Americans living in poverty has increased over the past decade, after a long period of decline. Wealth inequality has returned to levels last seen in the roaring '20s. Today, the U.S. unemployment rate is still just under 8%, higher than its average over the past two decades. Household debt soared over the past 20 years, though it has dipped slightly thanks to the credit crunch of the last few years. And while the story of water and air pollution over that period is a triumphant one, the long-term trends for global warming remain bleak. We are much more likely to hear about these negative trends than the positive ones for two primary reasons. First, we tend to assume that innovation and progress come from big technology breakthroughs, from new gadgets and communications technologies, most of them created by the private sector. But the positive trends in our social health are coming from a more complex network of forces: from government intervention, public service announcements, demographic changes, the shared wisdom of life experiences passed along through generations and the positive effects of rising affluence. The emphasis on private sector progress is no accident; it is the specific outcome of the way public opinion is shaped within the current media landscape. Opinion: How progress is possible in Obama's second term . The public sector doesn't have billions of dollars to spend on marketing campaigns to trumpet its successes. A multinational corporation invents a slightly better detergent, and it will spend a legitimate fortune to alert the world that the product is now \"new and improved.\" But no one takes out a prime-time ad campaign to tout the remarkable decrease in air pollution that we have seen over the past few decades, even thought that success story is far more important than a trivial improvement in laundry soap. That blind spot is compounded by the deeper lack of interest in stories of incremental progress. Curmudgeons, doomsayers, utopians and declinists all have an easier time getting our attention than opinion leaders who want to celebrate slow and steady improvement. The most striking example of this can be seen in the second half of the 1990s, a period in which both economic and social trends were decisively upbeat: The stock market was surging, but inequality was in fact on the decline; crime, drug use, welfare dependence, poverty -- all were trending in an encouraging direction. With a Democrat in the White House, you might assume that the op-ed pages of The Washington Post would be bursting with pride over the state of the nation, given the paper's center-left leanings. But you would be wrong. Over the course of 1997, in the middle of the greatest peacetime economic boom in U.S. history (and before the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke), 71% of all editorials published in the Post that expressed an opinion on some aspect of the country's current state focused on a negative trend. Less than 5% of the total number of editorials concentrated on a positive development. Even the boom years are a bummer. I suspect, in the long run, the media bias against incremental progress may be more damaging than any bias the media display toward the political left or right. The media are heavily biased toward extreme events, and they are slightly biased toward negative events -- though in their defense, that bias may just be a reflection of the human brain's propensity to focus more on negative information than positive, a trait extensively documented by neuroscience and psychology studies. The one positive social trend that did generate a significant amount of coverage -- the extraordinary drop in the U.S. crime rate since the mid-'90s -- seems to have been roundly ignored by the general public. The violent crime rate (crimes per thousand people) dropped from 51 to 15 between 1995 and 2010, truly one of the most inspiring stories of societal progress in our lifetime. And yet according to a series of Gallup polls conducted over the past 10 years, more than two-thirds of Americans believe that crime has been getting worse, year after year. Whether these biases come from media distortions or our human psychology, they result in two fundamental errors in the popular mind: We underestimate the amount of steady progress that continues around us, and we misunderstand where that progress comes from. We should celebrate these stories of progress, not so we can rest on our laurels but instead so we can inspire the next generation to build on that success. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Steven Johnson.",

         "(CNN) -- Ayat Al-Qassab carefully slipped the beaded satin wedding gown over her small frame. She peered at herself in the rusted mirror and cautiously smiled. For a moment, her war-torn world was transformed and she was a beautiful bride -- free, safe and happy. Boom! A mortar shell exploded somewhere near her Syrian home in Homs, waking her from a daydream. She quickly wrapped a white headscarf tightly around her hair and prepared to leave for her wedding. Only a week earlier, Al-Qassab met her husband-to-be, Mohammad Jumbaz. Their families had coordinated the introduction. He was a pastry chef and part-time fighter for the rebel Free Syrian Army which wants to oust President Bashar al-Assad. She was 18 and from a family who didn't like the al-Assad government. They took no lingering looks across the room, and time didn't stand still when their eyes met. They simply chatted as Syria's nearly 20-month-old civil war rumbled in the background. \"I had a feeling in my heart,\" Jumbaz said, recalling that day. \"I cannot describe it to you.\" During the interview, a shell boomed in the distance. \"In a time when we are under siege and there are sounds like this, I told my mother I decided to fulfill half my religion and to get married,\" he said, \"and without ever even seeing my bride, everything went perfect.\" Al-Qassab agrees. \"We saw each other and we liked each other,\" she said, \"and in just one week we were married to each other.\" Marriage as revolution . Homs has borne the brunt of the Syrian military's wrath since violence broke out nearly two years ago in the nation. Many who live in the city consider it to be the unbowed guardian of the Syrian revolt. A massacre in the spring killed scores of women and children. There, even marriage is an act of revolution. \"We must get married. Our lives must continue,\" Jumbaz said defiantly. \"We have not surrendered, and we will not surrender. This is a promise. A promise we will keep, God willing.\" Out of respect for the dead, the couple held a small ceremony in the family apartment rather than a traditional large and noisy Syrian wedding. \"It was not appropriate to dance and play music,\" Jumbaz said. \"We recently received the body of my martyred brother, and many other families have martyrs as well. So it was a small family affair.\" Speaking via Skype, the couple seems to have little interest in chatting about romance or the frivolities of weddings. Instead, both are enthralled with their love for revolution and an ancient country that appears lost to war and strife. \"I wore a white dress, but we did not have a traditional wedding because of this animal in power,\" Al-Qassab said. \"We hope once the regime falls we can have a wedding, because our happiness is the end of this government.\" The couple spent their honeymoon at home, struggling to survive as al-Assad's forces relentlessly shelled Homs. But Al-Qassab said she is very happy to stay. \"Here, we have our pride and we are defending our nation,\" she said. \"I would prefer my honeymoon to be here amid the bombs and shells then for me to abandon my nation.\" In the Middle East, where arranged marriages are common, there is an Arabic word for love after marriage: \"ashra.\" It means the love from living life together. It is emotion based on mutual respect, understanding and a need for a partner to survive all life's struggles. \"I am not upset that I got married under these circumstances,\" Al-Qassab said. \"The opposite. I am proud that I married one of the revolutionaries, and I am proud to be here in old Homs defending my nation and my dignity.\" Now, after more than a year and a half of violence, living life amid the constant killing and dying is the greatest form of rebellion for the couple. \"I took this step, because I am a man who has faith in God and destiny,\" Jumbaz said. \"The days that passed were very hard on us. I still thank God for everything, but I felt something was missing in my life. I do not know how to describe it. \"Every day was a struggle, but something was missing.\" A baker becomes a fighter . Before the Syrian civil war turned Homs into a conflict zone, Jumbaz owned a baked-sweets business, selling cakes and candy to the mainly pro-government Allawi and Christian districts near his native neighborhood in Homs' Old District. \"When my brother was killed, I decided to return to my community and support my people, because what was happening was unjust,\" he said. \"Seventy percent of my friends have been killed in this and that massacre. This is an unbearable level of injustice.\" Al-Assad must be tried for war crimes, he believes. Jumbaz joined the rebel Free Syrian Army and fought alongside other members of the armed opposition to liberate an opposition enclave in Homs. While the Old District remains under siege and constantly sustains shelling and mortar fire, Syrian troops remain outside the neighborhood, stationed along the outskirts of the suburb. \"There are enough Free Syrian Army troops to protect us now, but I noticed how difficult the situation is around us,\" Jumbaz said. Now, Jumbaz spends his days kneading rations of flour and bits of butter into dough, creating sweet, creamy Syrian desserts. \"The kids wanted sweets and many of the women were craving desserts, so I am trying to bake sweets again,\" he said. Faithful and not afraid . Al-Qassab said she visits her parents and relatives every day to help with household duties, and she checks on the well-being of her neighbors until the evening, when her new husband returns home. \"I am not afraid of anything happening to him, and I thank God. We are all willing to sacrifice our lives for Syria,\" Al-Qassad said. \"I thank God above all else.\" Another single loud explosion thundered in the background as they spoke. The couple didn't even flinch. \"I pray no one is hurt\" Jumbaz calmly said. He turned to his wife, who wore a faded purple coat and tight black headscarf. \"Please, go ahead,\" he said, kindly signaling her to speak. \"We will not surrender, God willing,\" she said. \"We are walking along the righteous path. My cousins, my neighbors, the children of my neighbors all died, and many more have lost their lives. But I am not sad. We will be victorious in this life and the afterlife.\" Al-Qassab looks older than her 18 years, and she speaks with impenetrable courage and bravery that generally masks any semblance of a giggling blushing bride only a few weeks into her marriage. \"We were married September 13, 2011,\" she said before finally cracking a smile and beginning to laugh. \"I mean 2012.\" She turns to her husband, blushing and embarrassed. He looks down to hide that he is laughing, too, instead mumbling to correct her: \"2012.\" Nothing it seems but sheer faith in God moves the newlyweds and inspires them to love, and to fight and resist forces in Syria they feel must end. After nearly every sentence, they defiantly say \"Alhamdulillah,\" a common Muslim phrase meaning \"I thank God.\" \"My only hope is that this monster will be removed from power so we can live in peace and our children can live in peace,\" Al-Qassab starts. \"And if not our kids, then the children of our community even if we die,\" her husband adds. \"Alhamdulillah.\"",

         "(CNN) -- Three experienced hikers were rescued from California's Mount Whitney, but a father and son in a separate group are missing, the National Park Service said. Battling heavy snow, rescue personnel and a California National Guard helicopter reached the three men around noon (3 p.m. ET) Thursday. The men were part of a group of 10 hikers who set out on their journey up the mountain on Monday. About 45 people looked for the three hikers -- Phillip Michael Abraham, 34; Dale Clymens, 45, and Stevan James Filips, 45 -- the National Park Service said in a statement. All three were able to walk and move during a general health assessment. Two other hikers on a 36-mile cross-country loop were supposed to return Tuesday. They are Sinh Baghsohi, 27, and his father, whose first name is unknown, park officials said. Both men are originally from Iran, but their current residences are not known. The younger Baghsohi is 6 feet, 5 inches tall and weighs about 287 pounds. His father is 6 feet tall and weighs 180 pounds. They had hiked in with a friend, who became ill and hiked out, the park service said. Dave Paladino, an Omaha, Nebraska, resident and leader of the larger group, said extreme weather dumped up to three feet of snow and drastically lowered visibility in Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks. The group of 10 hikers shared a love of climbing, outdoor activities and adventure, Paladino said. They set out on their hike shortly after 4 a.m. Monday in several sub-groups, including one led by Paladino and another including all three missing hikers. \"Every single one had been training for this event for years,\" said Paladino. The snow began for Paladino's group when they reached 10,000 feet up what he called the \"10-mile hill,\" and picked up significantly as they went up another 2,000 feet. His group reached the summit around 3:30 p.m. Monday, staying briefly at a shelter there before going back down the mountain. The climb back down was much more difficult than expected, according to Paladino, due to the heavy snow. \"It was by far the hardest thing we've ever done,\" said Paladino, who said he has climbed Mount Rainier in Washington state, among other peaks. At one point, his group met and talked briefly with the climbers who later went missing.  Abraham later sent several texts, the last of which was between 4 a.m. and 6 a.m. Tuesday in which they said they couldn't find the trail because of the snow and were heading to the summit shelter. The three climbers did not have snow shoes, said Paladino.  However, they likely had enough food and water to last several days, he said. Temperatures near the mountain's peak were in the 20s, Paladino added, not low enough to make frostbite a major concern. A rescue operation involving two hikers was begun and aborted Wednesday because of the snow. On Thursday morning, \"bigger and more experienced teams\" were brought in, said Paladino. \"We wanted to do this,\" said Paladino. \"These guys were doing what they loved, and we'll continue to do what we love.\"",

         "Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The Afghan Taliban are prepared to open an \"office outside the country for talks with foreigners,\" a purported spokesman for the movement said in a statement released Tuesday. The statement could signal the Taliban's public willingness to talk to the United States for the first time. Calling himself \"Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan spokesman,\" Zabiullah Mujaheed said the Taliban have a \"preliminary agreement with Qatar and other respective sides.\" The Taliban are asking for the release of prisoners from the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in exchange for opening the office, he said. He said the group is also \"ready for talks and negotiation inside the country.\" It appears to be the first time the Taliban -- who ruled Afghanistan from 1996 until 2001, when they were ousted in a U.S.-led invasion -- have offered talks without the condition of an American withdrawal from the country. Read more about Qatar as a mediator . It is not clear if the purported spokesman speaks for all parts of the loose-knit Afghan Taliban. His statement was released in Pashto, a local language. \"The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has always tried to solve any problem with its opposite side through talks,\" the statement said. The U.S. Embassy in Kabul responded cautiously to the statement. \"We support an Afghan-led reconciliation process in which the Taliban breaks with al Qaeda, renounces violence and accepts the Afghan constitution, especially protections for minorities and women,\" said Gavin Sundwall, a U.S. Embassy spokesman. In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the United States is prepared to support an Afghan-led reconciliation. \"But this process will only be successful if the Taliban are prepared to renounce violence, break ties with al Qaeda, support the Afghan constitution in all of its elements, including human rights for all citizens, and particularly for women,\" she said. Nuland said U.S. officials are not aware of any formal announcement, \"but we are prepared to support a process that the Afghans support. \" A top Afghan peace official said he was \"cautiously optimistic\" about the Taliban statement. \"We are optimistic that they want to come to the negotiating table, but we have to be cautious because words alone are not enough,\" said Ismail Qassemyar, a member of the country's High Peace Council. He agreed with the Americans that talks had to take place between Afghans. The peace talks are \"an Afghan process .... Americans can't give them anything in Afghanistan because America can't make any decision on behalf of the Afghan nation,\" he said. Last week he warned against the United States or other nations trying to strike their own peace deals with the militants. \"We ask our international friends not to hold any kind of talks with the Taliban leaders,\" Qassemyar said December 27. Recent media reports have said the United States and other foreign governments with a stake in the Afghan war may try to strike a separate deal with the Taliban. The Washington Post reported in December that the Obama administration reached a tentative deal with Taliban negotiators that would have included the Taliban's public renunciation of international terrorism and the transfer of five Afghans from Guantanamo Bay. The deal collapsed, the Post said, because of Afghan President Hamid Karzai's objections. Any talk of a peace process slowed in September when suicide bombers killed senior Afghan peace negotiator and former President Burhannudin Rabbani. Karzai told CNN in December that the government cannot hold talks until the Islamic militia identifies a representative with the authority to negotiate. Karzai said Rabbani's death showed that \"we were actually talking to nobody.\" \"A man who came in the name of a messenger for peace turned out to be a suicide bomber,\" Karzai said. \"Therefore, we have now clearly said that we will welcome a Taliban address, but that address must have the clarity that this representative is authorized and is representing the Taliban movement as we see it.\" Qassemyar said a Taliban office in Qatar would by no means legitimize the Islamist group. \"We accept an address for the Taliban in Qatar if they come there as a movement or a group, not a government or use it as a propaganda venue,\" he said.",

         "Washington (CNN)He ousted Egypt's first democratically elected president in a coup, crushed political dissent, let foreign journalists languish in jail and just jabbed the U.S. by greeting Vladimir Putin as a hero. Yet Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is fast becoming the favorite Middle East strongman of American conservatives and Republican presidential hopefuls. Jeb Bush says he can't understand why the White House has told Sisi \"you're not on our team\" as jihadism spreads like wildfire through the Middle East. Ted Cruz, another GOP 2016 pretender has also praised him, and key conservative media figures are lionizing Sisi. The rush of affection for the former Army Chief contrasts with the strained relationship between Sisi and the White House, reflected in the Obama administration's decision not to publicly back air strikes by Egypt on a common enemy -- ISIS -- in Libya this week. It's also the latest manifestation of the decades-long tussle between the U.S. and Egypt, which pits a push for human rights and democracy against the yearning for a stable pro-U.S. partner in a chaotic region, whatever the character of its regime. The spur for the conservative infatuation for Sisi was a speech in January in which the Egyptian leader warned Islam was being \"torn\" and \"destroyed\" by extremism. \"It's inconceivable that the thinking that we hold most sacred should cause the entire Islamic world to be a source of anxiety, danger, killing and destruction for the rest of the world,\" said Sisi. Sisi spoke in a highly symbolic venue, the Al Azhar Mosque in Cairo, one of the most vaulted seats of learning in the Muslim world. \"It's antagonizing the entire world! Does this mean that 1.6 billion people (Muslims) should want to kill the rest of the world's inhabitants -- that is 7 billion -- so that they themselves may live? Impossible!​\" On the face of it, Sisi's speech was a call to cleanse Islam of extremist thought and elements which groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda have used to justify jihad. It continues to impress conservatives in the United States amid a fierce political debate about how to contain ISIS's march across the region. \"He gave this incredible speech about Muslim extremism, and saying it's the responsibility of the Arab world to step up to fight this; that the first risks are for countries like Egypt,\" Bush said in Chicago on Wednesday. It's no coincidence that Republicans are praising the speech's blunt message at the same time as they are accusing President Barack Obama of falling prey to political correctness in his unwillingness to state the U.S. is at war with radical Islam. That comparison is also frequently being made on conservative talk radio. Cruz also praised Sisi on Fox News on Wednesday. \"What would be far better to see was the kind of courage that was demonstrated just a few weeks ago by President al-Sisi in Cairo,\" Cruz said. \"Why don't we see the president of the United States demonstrating that same courage, just to speak the truth, about the face of evil we are facing right now?\" Cruz asked. Mike Huckabee, another potential Republican presidential contender, said \"thank God for President al-Sisi in Egypt\" in an interview with NewsMax TV. Southern Baptist leader Richard Land wrote in The Christian Post that the Sisi speech could be as historically resonant as Martin Luther King's \"I have a Dream\" speech or president John Kennedy's declaration : \"Ich bin ein Berliner.\" Conservative commentator George Will said on Fox News Sunday last month that Sisi may deserve the Nobel Peace Prize. But are U.S. political figures ripping a speech redolent with Egyptian political overtones out of context to back up their own positions? Professor Nathan Brown of George Washington University said that Sisi's remarks were not that unusual and that a number of Arab leaders have previously given similar speeches to limited effect. \"It is standard stuff,\" he said. And Sisi's record toward political opponents and extremists, especially the Muslim Brotherhood, which formed Egypt's first democratic government until it was ousted by his army amid mass protests in 2013, paints a different picture of the Egyptian leader. \"The way that Sisi represents dealing with them is not through abstract theological arguments but through a severe security and political response,\" said Brown, who is also with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"That is what he represents. That part of the message gets lost.\" The State Department and rights groups fault Egypt for the removal of a civilian government, using lethal force to disburse MB protests, and for killing hundreds of protestors nationwide and say discrimination against Christians and Jews in Egypt remains widespread. Some analysts interpreted Sisi's speech as a way to justify the exclusion from politics of Islamist elements from political life in Egypt following his landslide win in an election last year in which the Brotherhood was banned. Since the election, the Obama administration has tried to carefully restore ties with Egypt on the grounds that it remains a vital strategic partner. Secretary of State John Kerry visited Cairo in September and Obama met Sisi on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York last year. Close intelligence cooperation continues behind the scenes. But relations have remained strained. After the coup the U.S. temporarily held up a tranch of $500 million in military aid to Egypt and an order of attack helicopters. Reconciliation has been made more difficult by the detention in Egypt of foreign journalists. The spectacle of Putin getting a warm welcome from Sisi in a visit last week did not go unnoticed in Washington, and was an apparent sign from the Cairo government that if the U.S. does not take better care of its friends, Egypt  will look elsewhere. The Pentagon, meanwhile, said it was not even told in advance about Egyptian air strikes this week on ISIS targets in Libya in revenge for the beheadings of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christian workers by an ISIS-affiliated group. \"It's a complex relationship that we have with Egypt,\" said Pentagon spokesman John Kirby. ISIS's swift spread in the Arab world has some realists in Washington considering whether it's time to re-emphasise the stability dimension of the U.S. relationship with Cairo. Bush suggested as much on Wednesday, in remarks that were especially noteworthy because the second term administration of his brother, George W. Bush, angered the government of then Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak by issuing a call for democracy in the Arab world as part of its Freedom Agenda. Jeb Bush asked Wednesday: \"Is (Sisi) a little \"L\" liberal democrat that believes in freedom like we do?\" \"No, he isn't. But I think we have to be practical,\" Bush said in the first foreign policy speech of his putative presidential campaign which could augur another turn in the roller coaster US-Egypt relationship. \"We have to balance our belief in liberty with a belief that security and engagement will create the possibilities for the Egyptians to garner more freedom. \"",

         "(CNN) -- The Florida judge presiding over the George Zimmerman murder trial ruled Monday that Zimmerman's attorneys will be able to present evidence about how Trayvon Martin may have been high on marijuana the night he was shot to death. Martin's toxicology report indicates that THC, the active drug in marijuana, was in his blood at the time of his death on February 26, 2012. Zimmerman, a former neighborhood watch captain, is charged with second-degree murder for killing 17-year-old Martin in Sanford, Florida. He told police that night that the teenager looked suspicious and that there had been several break-ins in the neighborhood. The two got into a physical altercation, and Zimmerman said he was forced to draw his gun and kill Martin. Zimmerman's attorneys argued Monday that the report shows Martin's judgment may have been impaired the night of the shooting and that it may have affected his decision-making. Prosecutors fought hard against the admission of Martin's THC levels, accusing Zimmerman's attorneys of trying to get bad-character evidence in through the backdoor. Judge Debra Nelson told prosecutors they could cross-examine expert defense witness who testify about the effects of THC. Prosecutors can also call their own expert to contradict the defense's case during their rebuttal. Zimmerman's drug use has also come up in the case. Ben Crump, Martin's family's attorney, says Zimmerman should have been tested for drugs the night of the shooting. A fire and EMS report says Zimmerman was on the medications Librax and Temazepam at the time of the incident. WebMD says Librax is a combination of two drugs, one that reduces stomach cramping and another drug that reduces anxiety. Temazepam, according to WebMD, is a sleep medication that is used for the short-term treatment of insomnia. It is not clear whether Zimmerman's drug use the night of the shooting will be admissible at trial.",

         "Hong Kong (CNN) -- At least 2,800 dead pigs have been fished from a Shanghai river since Friday, but authorities insist that tap water in the city is still safe to drink. State news agency Xinhua said labels tagged to the pigs' ears indicated they came from the upper waters of the Huangpu River, which flows through the center of Shanghai and is a source of the city's drinking water. It's not clear why the pigs had been dumped in the river, though local media reported earlier this month that a disease had killed thousands of pigs in a village south of Shanghai. \"We will continue to trace the source, investigate the cause, co-operate with neighboring areas and take measures to stop the dumping of pigs into rivers,\" the Shanghai Municipal Agricultural Commission said in a statement posted on their website on Monday. As of Sunday, water quality on the Songjiang section of the river, where most of the pigs were found, remained normal and the incident has had \"no significant effect on tap water supply,\" the commission added. However, local residents and users of of the popular Twitter-like microblog service Sina Weibo have expressed concern that the dead pigs would make the city's tap water unsafe to drink. \"Huangpu river is the source of drinking water for more than 20 million Shanghai residents. And this horrific incident was only made public when residents started posting pictures on Weibo,\" business investor Xue Manzi said in a post on his account. The agricultural commission said it had tested organ samples from the pig carcasses and the results suggested the animals had contracted a type of porcine circovirus. According to Professor Fred Leung, who specialises in animal diseases at Hong Kong University, this is a fairly common disease in pigs and not usually fatal on its own. Pictures showed sanitation workers with sticks retrieving the bloated bodies of small pigs caught up in reeds and debris at the side of the river. A local newspaper in Jiaxing, a city in Zhejiang province south of Shanghai, reported on March 6 that tens of thousands of pigs had died of an animal disease in a major pig farming village in the past two months. \"According to our records, 10,078 pigs died in January, another 8,325 died in February. More than 300 pigs die everyday in our village, and we barely have any space left to dispose of the dead pigs,\" a local villager was quoted by the paper as saying. Chen Yi, a veterinarian at the Shanghai Academy of Agricultural Sciences, told the Global Times newspapers that farmers are required by law to dispose of dead animals at community disposal sites or bury them with disinfectant. CNN's Zhang Dayu reported from Beijing .",

         "Washington (CNN)  -- President Obama told his war council Wednesday that the U.S. troop commitment to Afghanistan is not open-ended, and he asked for revisions to options he previously received for sending more troops, a senior administration official told CNN. The war council -- made up of top Cabinet, Pentagon and administration officials -- met with Obama for the eighth time to discuss a request by the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan for up to 40,000 more troops. The meeting lasted more than two hours, according to the senior administration official. \"The president and his team discussed the length of time that it would take to implement the options he's been presented,\" the senior official said. \"The president believes that we need to make clear to the Afghan government that our commitment is not open-ended. After years of substantial investments by the American people, governance in Afghanistan must improve in a reasonable period of time to ensure a successful transition to our Afghan partner.\" In particular, Obama pushed for revisions in proposed plans for troop increases to clarify how and when U.S. troops would turn over responsibility to the Afghan government, the official said. The president's questions at the meeting could change how many troops eventually are sent to Afghanistan, as well as how long they would be there, according to the senior administration official. Before the meeting, Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. military commander in the Middle East, said the meeting would continue evaluating how best to carry out the mission in Afghanistan. Petraeus provided no specifics on options under consideration, but said the process is approaching completion. \"I think we are indeed nearing a decision on this very important topic,\" he said, emphasizing the need to focus on the mission of ensuring that Afghanistan \"does not once again become a sanctuary or safe haven for al Qaeda and the kind of transnational extremists that carried out the 9/11 attacks.\" Earlier, a senior administration official and a U.S. military official independently told CNN that one option presented to Obama calls for sending about 34,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan in addition to the 68,000 already committed to the country. The military official said the plan would send three U.S. Army brigades, totaling about 15,000 troops; a Marine brigade of about 8,000 troops; a headquarters element of about 7,000 troops; and 4,000 to 5,000 support troops. The combat brigades would be brought in gradually, in three-month intervals, according to the military official. The troops would be spread across the country, mainly focusing in the south and southeast, where much of the fighting is, according to the official. The military official said the option has been a favorite at the Pentagon in recent weeks. That is only one option, the senior administration official emphasized. Three other options, the official said, would be \"different mixes,\" or \"different components of it.\" The senior administration official said Obama was expected to ask the war council meeting about cooperation the United States can expect from the government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai, civilian support the United States is willing to offer, and support the United States can expect from other countries. On Wednesday night, The Washington Post and The New York Times reported that concerns have been raised recently by the U.S. Ambassador in Kabul about Karzai's ability to rid his country's government of corruption and mismanagement. All those factors could lead to \"further refinements\" or some \"greater elements being considered,\" the official said, adding: \"He's got to fine-tune this, put it all together ... for what direction best advances our interests.\" Despite reports to the contrary, Obama has not decided the number of U.S. troops he will send to Afghanistan, White House officials said. Such reports are \"absolutely false,\" Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said. Anyone who suggests otherwise, \"doesn't have, in all honesty, the slightest idea what they're talking about.\" White House officials would not say whether Wednesday's meeting with the war council would be Obama's last with that group before deciding on Afghanistan. They said he would continue to discuss the war effort in smaller groups in coming days, including during his trip to Asia, which starts Thursday. Republican members of the Senate Armed Services Committee urged Obama in a letter sent Wednesday -- Veterans Day -- to agree to the request for additional troops by U.S. military leaders in Afghanistan. The letter, signed by 10 GOP committee members, said success in Afghanistan will require local leaders and citizens being able to govern and secure their own country without \"substantial\" international assistance. \"This won't be perfect or easy, but it will allow America's fighting men and women to leave Afghanistan with honor, and it will enable Afghans to build a better, more peaceful future,\" the letter said. \"That is our goal, and we must stay in the fight until is is won.\" Republican leaders have criticized Obama for taking so long to decide on the troop request, but Petraeus said the process of analyzing the situation has been \"very useful.\" \"There has been a refinement of objectives; there has been discussion of various courses of action,\" he said. \"There have been explanations and discussions about how the civilian component of this will complement what is done by the work of our military troops. All in all, I think it has been a very productive couple of months that we have spent on this.\" Also Wednesday, a new national poll showed Americans are split over whether Obama is taking too long to decide whether to send more U.S. troops to the war in Afghanistan. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey also indicated that, by a narrow margin, Americans think the president should listen to the recommendations of the generals in charge of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. According to the survey, 49 percent of people questioned say the president is taking too long to decide whether to increase U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan; 50 percent do not. \"There is a gender gap on this question, with most men saying Obama is taking too long and most women willing to give him more time,\" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. \"That's due in part to the partisan differences between men and women, but gender differences on the use of military force, and maybe even differences in how the genders make important decisions, can also be contributing to the split.\" The poll indicates that 52 percent think Obama should listen to the generals, with 48 percent saying the president should take other matters into account as well. But a troop buildup remains unpopular, with a separate question indicating that a majority opposes sending more troops. Roughly one in five Americans opposes more troops, yet also thinks that Obama should pay attention to the U.S. military leaders in that country, Holland said. \"That suggests that a lot of people who don't support a troop build-up are unaware of Gen. Stanley McChrystal's request for a bigger U.S. military presence there,\" he said. \"And that, in turn, indicates that the military leaders in the field might provide Obama some political cover if he decides to increase troop strength there.\" The poll also suggests widespread agreement among Americans that Afghanistan will never have a stable democratic government, with only one in 10 people questioned saying that will occur within a year, and one-third saying it will ever happen. Overall, 56 percent of Americans oppose sending more troops, while 42 percent favor increasing troop strength. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted October 30-November 1, with 1,018 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points for the overall sample. CNN Deputy Political Director Paul Steinhauser and Tom Cohen contributed to this story.",

         "(CNN) -- A Nevada city councilwoman who faced possible sanctions over a travel expense voucher and public comments was found dead with her husband Tuesday, hours before a City Council meeting that had the issues involving her on its agenda, officials said. Donna Fairchild and Bill Fairchild were found in a residence in the city of Mesquite, Nevada, on Interstate 15 near the border with Arizona, authorities said. Police got a call from the residence about 4:30 a.m. Each apparently suffered a single gunshot wound, the city said. Autopsies are scheduled for Wednesday. Results from the Clark County Coroner's Office were expected to take four to six weeks, according to a statement from the city. Mesquite city spokesman Bryan Dangerfield would not comment on the circumstances of their deaths but said police confirmed that a note and a 9 mm handgun were found at the scene. \"The content of the note will not be disclosed until the investigation is complete,\" Dangerfield said. City Manager Timothy Hacker said he believed that Donna Fairchild was concerned about the agenda items, according to CNN Las Vegas affiliate KLAS. The City Council was required to meet Tuesday night, but in light of the day's events, Dangerfield said the allegations against Fairchild probably would not be debated. Two prayers were offered by pastors during the meeting, he said. Fairchild, who was a candidate for mayor, told the Desert Valley Times last week that she would not comment on the allegations against her, but instead would talk about them Tuesday night. Mayor Susan Holecheck and City Attorney Cheryl Truman Hunt had planned to ask the City Council to consider sanctioning Fairchild through possible reprimand, removal from boards or expulsion for filing a $94.60 mileage reimbursement request with the city for a January 4 Nevada Development Authority board meeting she allegedly did not attend, according to an item on the council agenda. Fairchild allegedly violated the city's code of conduct and its personnel policy, and allegedly fraudulently presented a claim to a public officer, Hunt wrote in a January 18 memo. Holecheck, who is seeking re-election, and Hunt also wanted the City Council to consider removing Fairchild as the city's representative to the Nevada Development Authority board of directors. According to a filing on the agenda, comments Fairchild made about the development authority in a newspaper article \"were negative towards this agency, and deemed incompatible with the mission of the agency and good working relations with other NDA board members.\" A January 7 article of the Desert Valley Times includes interviews and comments from Mesquite mayoral candidates. In the article, Fairview said, \"We just got a bill from the Nevada Development Authority: It costs $7,500 to belong. There was one thing that came out of the NDA, and that was Do It Best. That was huge for the community, but I don't think we're getting the bang for our buck.\" In the article, Fairchild said that Mesquite should be doing most of its own marketing. NDA Executive Director Somer Hollingsworth wrote Holecheck that Fairchild -- who was the city's representative to the board since July 2009 -- should have brought her concerns to him, rather than airing them publicly, especially since she was a member of the NDA executive committee, according to an e-mail attached with the filing. According to the agenda item, Fairchild could have discussed her issues with the NDA if she had attended the January 4 board meeting. Messages seeking comment were left with Holecheck and Hunt on Tuesday. A statement from the mayor's office and City Council said, \"It is with a heavy heart that we make this announcement. Mesquite has lost two citizens that have devoted their life to public service. On behalf of myself and the City Council, this is a tremendous loss to our community and we express our deepest sympathies to the Fairchilds' family, loved ones and friends.\" Donna Fairchild served on the City Council from 2001 to 2007 and was re-elected in 2009. She moved to Mesquite with Bill Fairchild in 1999 after they both retired from the Denver Police Department, the city said. Donna Fairchild also has been an EMT/paramedic and news reporter for KIMN/KYGO radio in Denver. In Mesquite, Bill worked at a recreation center and was a member of the Virgin Valley Honor Guard and the Veterans of Foreign War. The Fairchilds were married for 21 years, the city said.

         "Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The U.S. government has confirmed the killing of al Qaeda operational commander Ilyas Kashmiri,  the prime minister of Pakistan said Monday. \"The U.S. has confirmed that Ilyas Kashmiri was killed on Friday,\" said Prime Minister Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani at a Monday press conference in Quetta, the capital of the country's southwestern province of Balochistan. Gilani did not explain how he knew the United States had confirmed the death of the man described by counterterrorism officials as al Qaeda's \"military brain.\" A spokesman for Kashmiri's jihadist group, Harakat-ul-Jihad-Islami, previously said Kashmiri was killed, along with some aides, in a strike late Friday night. Kashmiri's death is the first major kill or capture since Osama Bin Laden, and the highest profile drone target since Beitullah Mehsud in 2009. It could also be seen as an embarrassment for Pakistanis, who have twice in just over one month, had a major al Qaeda figure killed on their territory without their participation. U.S. drones now operate entirely autonomously in Pakistan, a Pakistani intelligence source has told CNN. Whereas before the United States cooperated with Pakistan and used their intelligence, today, the Americans have an intelligence network that allows them to go after terrorists unilaterally. Kashmiri, a veteran jihadist, was considered one of the most dangerous men in the world by counterterrorism officials on three continents. He was commander of \"Brigade 313\" of Harakat-ul-Jihad-Islami, which has formed a close relationship with al Qaeda. Kashmiri was also said to have ties with David Coleman Headley, the U.S. citizen who confessed to helping scout targets for the Mumbai attack in November 2008.",

         "(CNN) -- Officers involved in a 2012 shooting in Cleveland are suing the city and police officials, alleging racial discrimination. They claim the defendants have a pattern of treating non-African American officers harsher than African American officers, when it comes to officer-involved shootings of African Americans. The plaintiffs in the federal suit are not African American. The incident cited in the suit began when officers saw a car speeding and heard what they thought was a gunshot directed towards them. It involved a nearly 25-minute chase and ended in a hail of 137 bullets, killing two people. Both were African American. No weapon was ever found in the car. In the wake of the shooting, the plaintiffs say they were placed on administrative leave for three days before reporting \"to the gym\" for a 45-day cooling off period. Months later, most of them were permitted to return to full duty, but they were then ordered back on restrictive duty, in a move the lawsuit claims was \"politically expedient.\" They remained on restrictive duty until June 2014 and so missed out on potential wages and chances to apply for promotions and transfers, according to the lawsuit. The nine plaintiffs allege their treatment was because of their race. \"The City of Cleveland, through the other named defendants, and the other named defendants in their individual capacities, have a history of treating non-African American officers involved in the shootings of African Americans substantially harsher than African American officers,\" reads the lawsuit, filed Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. It continues: \"A serious dichotomy exists as a result of the defendants' longstanding practices and procedures which place onerous burdens on non-African American officers, including the plaintiffs, because of their race and the race of persons who are the subjects of the legitimate use of deadly force.\" The plaintiffs are seeking an unspecified amount of damages. After-hours attempts Sunday to reach representatives of the city and police department were unsuccessful. The lawsuit comes on the heels of another high-profile police shooting in Cleveland. A 12-year-old boy died a week ago Sunday after being shot outside a recreation center. He had what police have said was an air gun that looked like a real firearm. Authorities are investigating that shooting, and the two officers involved are on leave from their jobs. In March 2013, the U.S. Justice Department announced an investigation into the use of force by Cleveland police, citing several incidents. That investigation is also ongoing.

         "(CNN) -- Rapper T.I., who was sentenced to a 366-day prison sentence in March,  reported Tuesday to a federal prison complex in Forrest City, Arkansas,  according to CNN affiliate WSB-TV. T.I., left, performed to a packed crowd Sunday, days before he was to start a prison term. The rapper -- whose real name is Clifford Harris Jr. -- was required to be at the prison before noon local time to begin serving his sentence on federal weapons charges. According to news reports, officers from Forrest City and the prison set up a roadblock along Arkansas Highway 1 about one-tenth of a mile from the complex. Reporters were not allowed any closer to the prison. T.I. threw himself a going-away party Sunday night at Philips Arena in Atlanta, Georgia, before a packed house. During Sunday's concert -- called \"T.I.'s Final Goodbye Bash\" -- the 28-year-old Grammy winner reiterated a message that's become familiar in recent weeks: He wants others to learn from his mistakes. \"I'm doing the best I can to get out there, man, and put something positive on these young kids, man,\" T.I. said during the show. \"I try my best. I need y'all help, though.\" The rapper played to a sell-out crowd of 16,000 people, said Kenan Woods, a spokesman for the arena. T.I. played through much of his catalog, including the hits \"Whatever You Like,\" \"Live Your Life\" and the Grammy-winning \"Swagga Like Us,\" Woods said. At times in the show, Harris was joined on stage by fellow rapper Soulja Boy and by his five children and mother, Woods said. T.I. was sentenced in March on weapons charges related to purchasing machine guns and silencers. In addition to serving prison time, T.I. was placed on house arrest, was given community service and was ordered to pay a $100,300 fine. Though he had been in legal trouble before, Harris' current situation began when he was arrested just hours before he was to perform at the BET Hip-Hop Awards in Atlanta. The rapper had provided a bodyguard with $12,000 to buy weapons. Harris was not permitted to own any guns, however, because he was convicted in 1998 on felony drug charges -- possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute -- in Cobb County, in suburban Atlanta. After his arrest, he entered a plea agreement, which federal authorities called unique because it allowed the rapper to remain out of prison for a year while he performed community service. Harris has already left a strong mark on the hip-hop genre, music experts told CNN, which should position his career well when he is released. Harris had been named to the Forbes list of top-earning rappers, making an estimated $16 million in 2006. Some music industry observers have said T.I.'s prison term will only make him more popular. \"I think that if anything, it will gain him more fans and actually support his fan base, because he's talked about making a mistake,\" Emil Wilbekin, editor in chief of Giant Magazine, told CNN. \"He's talked about taking care of the error of his ways.\" The Atlanta rapper has expressed remorse for the situation. \"I would like to say thank you to some and apologize to others,\" he said at his sentencing in March. \"In my life, I have been placed in the worst-case scenario and had to make the best of it.\" In a March interview with CNN's T.J. Holmes, Harris said he no longer felt like he needed to carry weapons to protect himself. He said people should not idolize him for what he's gone through, but should take note of the fact that he has taken responsibility for his actions. \"You shouldn't take the things that I've gone through, and the negative parts of my life, and admire me for that. If anything, admire me for how I've accepted responsibility for the part I played in placing myself in these situations, and what I've done to recover from it,\" Harris said. Harris has been the subject of an MTV reality show, \"T.I.'s Road to Redemption,\" in the lead-up to the prison term.",

         "Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- The Libyan war may be over, but rivalries rage on among some regional militias, leading to a mutual distrust that poses a challenge to the new leadership. Earlier this week, the rivalry was evident when dozens of fighters clashed at a Tripoli hospital in what residents said was the biggest armed confrontation in the capital in weeks. Clashes erupted at 2 a.m. Monday when a half dozen former rebels from Zintan city in the western mountains stormed the hospital, according to doctors. Some of the former rebels were drunk, and demanded staff hand over a wounded fighter shot earlier that day, according to the doctors, who spoke on condition of anonymity for safety reasons. The patient and the body of a dead fighter had been taken to the hospital earlier, the doctors said, and the former rebels wanted to kill the wounded man. Hospital staff declined to hand over the patient, who was undergoing surgery. Tripoli fighters in charge of hospital security forced them out , but not before the returning fighters shot rounds in the hospital. Both groups called for backup, which arrived as fighting raged around the hospital grounds until 5 a.m. Witnesses said both sides were using heavy machine guns and anti-aircraft guns. Walls near a hospital entrance were riddled with bullets holes, and nearby glass doors and windows were shattered. Across the street, bullets pierced through the walls of two buildings. There were no deaths from gunshots, but medical staff said three patients died of stress-related causes that they linked to the fighting. At least three of the Tripoli fighters were wounded in the clashes, according to Salem Abaza, who is in charge of hospital security. He described it as the most serious incident of infighting so far. Accounts differed over how the three-hour battle concluded, but at least three witnesses said it ended after calls from a local imam and senior commanders from both groups talked by phone with their men. Tripoli fighters said Tuesday they are concerned about the rising tensions among the various groups, which are increasingly divided along regional allegiances. \"We are concerned, as you can see, every day there is fighting between the rebels, this is something we don't want, we want a united Libya,\" said fighter Tammam Basheer. The scene on Tripoli's streets these days -- heavily armed men brandishing guns and racing across the city with no central command and little or no accountability -- has raised concerns among residents. \"There are no security forces, everyone is running their own group, their own brigade, and they all control Tripoli,\" said Tripoli militia member Taha, who did not provide a second name. Disarming tens of thousands of fighters who brought down ruler Moammar Gadhafi and bringing them under control is a top challenge for the fledgling interim government. Acting Prime Minister Abdurrahim El-Keib is expected to present his Cabinet within two weeks. Military officials downplayed the tensions among the various militias, and say their biggest challenge is rebuilding the military. \"We would like to reorganize our army again,\" said Col. Ahmed Bani, the National Transitional Council's military spokesman. \"When we have a great and strong army, we are safe. We will save our dreams, we will save our democracy, our borders.\" At the Tripoli hospital, staff spoke of other recent incidents of intimidation by armed militiamen and called on authorities to provide protection and pull the weapons off the streets. \"We are really afraid, we do not want stethoscopes to be fighting guns,\" Dr. Ali Osman said.",

         "Washington (CNN) -- With time running out for Congress to prevent a doubling of interest rates on federal student loans, the White House and Republican leaders exchanged accusations Thursday on who was to blame for the lack of an agreement. President Barack Obama chided Republicans for holding up a deal with unreasonable demands, and he urged college students to continue raising their voices on the issue. However, spokesmen for Republican leaders in the House and Senate denied an assertion by press secretary Jay Carney that the White House has been working with them to try to reach a deal. Asked about GOP complaints that the White House has not reached out to Republicans on the issue in recent days, Carney said that \"we are actively working with members of Congress to get this done,\" adding, \"in both parties.\" Spokesmen for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, disputed Carney's account. On the Senate floor, McConnell accused Obama and Democrats of playing political games on the issue. \"It is the Democrat-led Senate that has failed to act and the president who has failed to contribute to a solution, and the reason is obvious,\" McConnell said. \"It was reported yesterday that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is launching a website with a student loan countdown clock aimed at raising money off this issue. The implication is that Republicans are the ones dragging their feet. \" The only reason the issue remains unresolved \"is that the president wants to keep it alive,\" McConnell said, adding that \"he thinks it benefits him politically for college students to believe we're the problem.\" Despite such political back-and-forth, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said that \"a series of meetings over the last 48 hours\" with Republicans had raised hopes for a deal. \"At this stage, it appears that they are compromising, just as we are, and hope we can get something done,\" Reid said. Leaders of both parties insist that they want to keep the federally backed rate at 3.4% for another year, but they sharply disagree over how to pay the $6 billion cost. Democrats want to eliminate certain tax benefits for small-business owners, while Republicans want to cut a preventive-care fund created in 2010 as part of Obama's health care reform law. The Republican-majority House has passed its version of the measure, which Obama has threatened to veto. The Senate continues to negotiate an alternative version. If Congress fails to act by July 1, the rate jumps to 6.8%, with an average cost to students of $1,000 in increased loan debt, according to the White House. In his remarks at the White House to students campaigning for an extension of the current rate, Obama blamed Republicans for preventing a deal. \"Last month, Democrats in the Senate put forward a plan that would have kept these rates in place without adding a dime to the deficit. Unfortunately, Senate Republicans got together and blocked it,\" Obama said. \"Over in the House, the Republicans said they'd keep these rates down only if we agreed to cut things like preventative health care for women, which obviously wouldn't fix the problem but would create a new problem,\" the president continued. He also poked fun at an unidentified congressman, presumably Republican, who Obama said had warned that the student loan rate issue was about giving students \"free college education.\" That complaint \"doesn't make much sense, because the definition of a loan is, it's not free; you have to pay it back,\" Obama said. While Obama has repeatedly raised the issue in campaign appearances, certain GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney has also said Congress should act to keep the rate at 3.4%. In 2007, lawmakers temporarily cut the rate for undergraduates taking out federal Stafford loans up to the 2011 school year. The lower rates were phased in, so students have been able to access the lowest 3.4% rate on subsidized federal loans for only one school year. The 2007 law allows interest rates to revert back to 6.8% for the 2012-13 school year, which starts in July. CNN's Jessica Yellin, Alan Silverleib and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.",

         "(CNN) -- A Pennsylvania man who walked into a gym aerobics class and opened fire, killing three women and wounding nine before turning the gun on himself, \"had a lot of hatred in him,\" police said Wednesday. Pregnant aerobics instructor Mary Primis was teaching class when the gunman opened fire, critically injuring her. George Sodini, 48, brought four handguns into the LA Fitness gym outside Pittsburgh and used three of them, firing at least 36 times around 8 p.m. Tuesday, Allegheny County Police Superintendent Charles Moffatt said. Sodini, a member of the gym, was found dead in the aerobics room, lying on top of one of his guns about seven feet from one of the victims. Authorities believe Sodini targeted the aerobics class, because a schedule was found in his home with that class circled, Moffatt said. But police do not believe he targeted anyone personally. An online diary, as well as notes at the scene and at his home, have led them to believe he was targeting women in general. Read an edited version of the diary (PDF) In the note found at the scene in Sodini's gym bag, he complains he had never spent a weekend with a woman, never vacationed with a woman and never lived with a woman, and that he had had limited sexual experiences, Moffatt said. He makes similar complaints in his online blog, which also documents his growing rage at women for rejecting him and at the world he felt had abandoned him. Witnesses told police the gunman was dressed in black when he entered the class, shut off the lights, walked about 10 feet and opened fire. Mary Primis, 26, an aerobics instructor who is 10 weeks pregnant, was shot twice. \"I remember thinking I wanted to hold my breath because I was afraid, if he saw that I was breathing, he would shoot again,\" she told CNN affiliate WPXI from her hospital bed. Asked if she thought she was going to die, she said, \"I wasn't sure.\" Her husband, Alex Primis, said she was shot once in the left shoulder and again through the back of her shoulder blade. This was to be her last week teaching before taking time off for her pregnancy, Primis said. Sodini apparently had \"practice runs\" before the shooting Tuesday, Moffatt said. Someone at the gym had showed him how to shut off the lights, he said, not knowing his plans. \"He just had a lot of hatred in him, and he was hell bent on committing this act,\" Moffatt said.  Watch Moffatt describe contents of diary » . Sodini worked as a systems analyst in the finance department of K&L Gates, a law firm with an office in Pittsburgh, since 1999, Mike Rick, a spokesman for the firm, said. Neighbors described him as reclusive and said he had stopped talking to them in the past few years. On Tuesday, Sodini visited the gym three times -- the first about 11 a.m., a second time at 7:40 p.m. and a third time at 7:56 p.m., Moffatt said. Members of the gym are required to swipe a card to check in, but do not have to check out, he said. The first 911 call was dispatched at 8:16 p.m. Three of the four guns found with Sodini were traced back to him, and authorities are in the process of tracing the fourth, Moffatt said. They were two 9 mm semi-automatics, a .45-caliber revolver and a .38 in his pocket. Sodini also had 30-round ammunition clips that were illegal before the assault weapons ban was lifted in 2004, police said. Police know Sodini made a telephone call at 7:45 p.m., and believe he may have left the gym to make it. Authorities are attempting to locate the person he contacted, Moffatt said. Sodini did not mention killing himself in the note found at the scene, which was mostly typed with handwritten notations, but did mention it in a handwritten note found at his home, Moffatt said. Police seized Sodini's car for processing, but no guns were found in it, he said. They also seized his computer and were examining it. The shooting victims were taken to the three major hospitals in the area. Moffatt said he believed none of those who remained hospitalized Wednesday had life-threatening injuries. County officials said counselors were being made available to area residents in the wake of the shooting. Police spoke to a pastor mentioned on Sodini's online diary. The man said Sodini attended his church but stopped in 2006, and that there was a minor incident involving a woman who felt \"he was paying too much attention to her,\" Moffatt said. The pastor spoke to Sodini, and it stopped, he said. Moffatt said police have no knowledge of any mental health issues involving Sodini, but are still puzzled at the violence. \"I can't ever make sense of murders,\" he said.

         "(CNN) -- As a young competitive gymnast, Melissa Stockwell's heart would fill with pride as she looked at the American flag and sang the national anthem before every meet. When anyone would ask her what she wanted to be when she grew up, she would say she wanted to join the Army. Stockwell's parents thought she was going through a phase, but she joined the ROTC program while at the University of Colorado in Boulder. After graduating with a communications degree in 2002, she was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army's Transportation Corps. At 23 years old, Stockwell was deployed to Iraq in March 2004. Less than a month later, her life changed forever. She was part of a routine convoy going through central Baghdad when a big explosion went off. \"Think of the loudest noise you can imagine and our vehicle starts to swerve,\" she recalls. \"The woman in the front yells IED, IED, we've hit an IED!\" Stockwell's left leg was gone. \"It sounds strange, but as soon as I was told I didn't have my leg, I knew it was going to be OK,\" the veteran says. \"I just kind of had this almost peaceful feeling that, alright, it's going to be alright. Life isn't over.\" While recovering at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, Stockwell says she was inspired by other patients. \"You see these other soldiers and these other veterans that are missing two limbs, three limbs, sometimes four limbs ... and I looked at myself and I just really thought I'm one of the lucky ones and I kind of made a decision then that I was going to live my life for those who couldn't.\" Stockwell learned to walk with her new leg and become independent, but she knew she wouldn't feel like herself until she got back into sports. Opinion: Every day should be Veterans Day . \"Luckily there are organizations out there that really grab the wounded veterans from their hospital rooms and get them out doing things that they may not have ever done with two legs,\" she says. Four months after her injury, she went skiing in Colorado. The experience gave her an incredible feeling of freedom and opened up a world of new possibilities. After spending a year at Walter Reed, the Purple Heart and Bronze Star recipient medically retired from the Army. Stockwell went back to school for a new career in prosthetics at Century College in Minnesota. \"Basically you fit amputees with artificial limbs,\" she says. \"I didn't know the field existed until I needed a leg, but then I thought, 'Well that's pretty cool.' \" After moving to Minnesota, she joined her first competitive swim team. A presentation about the Paralympics inspired her to fight for her country on a new battlefield. \"I dreamed of going to the Olympics when I was younger,\" she says. \"And now it was almost like I had a second chance. So I decided to try in the sport of swimming. It was easy for me to swim. I didn't have to wear a prosthetic leg.\" In 2008, Stockwell became the first Iraq war veteran to be chosen for the U.S. Paralympic Team. She felt like her life had come full circle: \"It made me feel so, so alive.\" Today the 32-year-old veteran works as a certified prosthetist at Scheck and Siress in Chicago and runs a triathlon club she started with friends Keri Schindler and Dan Tun two years ago. Dare2Tri provides adaptive equipment and coaches for athletes with disabilities. Cancer survivor and amputee Hailey Danisewicz says Dare2Tri has taught her that, \"my possibilities as a person are endless and that I can do anything that I put my mind to.\" In October Danisewicz placed second at the Paratriathlon World Championships in New Zealand. First place, for the third consecutive year, went to her coach and mentor Melissa Stockwell.",

         "(CNN) -- A man caught on camera beating a woman in front of her young child has been charged on several counts of attempted murder, robbery, burglary and aggravated assault, Essex County, New Jersey, Assistant Prosecutor Jamel Semper said Friday. Shawn Custis, 42, allegedly forced his way into a Millburn, New Jersey, home around 10 a.m. on June 21 and brutally beat the woman while her young daughter sat motionless on a nearby couch. The woman's 18-month old son was sleeping upstairs. Custis fled the house with an undetermined amount of jewelry, Millburn police said. The entire episode was caught on the family's home security camera. Custis was also indicted on counts of endangering the welfare of a child, criminal restraint, and theft, according to Semper. Custis is currently being held at the Essex County Correctional Facility on $750,000 bail, prosecutors said. In the home video obtained by CNN affiliate WABC, Custis repeatedly punches the woman in the face while her daughter watches nearby. He throws her to the floor, chokes her, kicks her multiple times, and throws her down a flight of stairs. He does not hurt the daughter. After he leaves, the woman goes upstairs to retrieve her toddler son and waits with her two children for police to arrive. On the video, the child who witnessed the attack appears to be as young as 5 years old and likely no more than 8. The woman who was beaten told CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey that she made a conscious decision to try to remain silent in an attempt to protect her daughter. \"I knew that if I started screaming, my daughter would too, and I was afraid that she would get hurt,\" she said at the time. \"I took it. I didn't cry the entire time.\" The woman was later taken to an area hospital, where she was treated for a concussion, chipped teeth, and injuries to her face and legs, according to prosecutors. Custis was arrested in New York City by the FBI Fugitive Task Force and detectives from the Essex County Prosecutor's Office. Custis is to be arraigned on February 28, said the prosecutor's office. Custis' attorney, Olubukola \"Bukie\" Adetula, told CNN that he anticipates Custis will plead not guilty. \"We will do what we have to do to defend this case aggressively,\" Adetula said. Millburn is a small suburban community about 10 miles east of Newark.",

         "(CNN) -- If one brings a gun to a fistfight, then the fight becomes a gunfight. Simple reasoning, of course, but it's also an unnecessary consequence of combining legislation that makes guns readily available with \"stand your ground\" laws. I can already hear the clicking of keyboards from my desk, as the drinkers of NRA-flavored Kool-Aid feverishly type their outrage and disgust with any suggestion that gun laws need to be reviewed. I own guns. They are kept in my home. I strongly believe in the \"castle doctrine,\" which essentially means that homeowners have no duty or requirement to retreat in their home if they are attacked within it. If someone breaks into a stranger's home, the homeowner doesn't know whether the intruder is there to rob, rape, terrorize or have milk and cookies with them. Regardless, it's reasonable that a robber should have an expectation of death if he or she breaks into someone's home. Unstable ground: The fine line between self-defense and murder . Florida's stand your ground law was passed in 2005, under Gov. Jeb Bush's administration. This is the law that has garnered so much national attention since the Trayvon Martin shooting and George Zimmerman's arrest. Stand your ground legislation basically extends the castle doctrine to all places beyond the home. Retreat in order to avoid a confrontation becomes unnecessary even in a public place. Florida Statute 776.013 (3) states: . \"A person who is not engaged in unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.\" This law applies a confusing blend of subjective and objective standards. Stand your ground is appropriate in many circumstances, but the lack of clarity in the statute needs to be addressed and re-evaluated, particularly when firearms are so readily accessible in public places. The way the statute is written, an individual who observes a fistfight could conceivably shoot and kill the dominator in the fight if they reasonably believed that person was going to cause \"great bodily harm\" to the other. Even if the two combatants knew that the fight was nothing more than a \"good ol' boy\" disagreement, the way the statute is written could allow a gun to be used if the observer reasonably and actually believed that great bodily harm could occur. Moreover, merging the statute with overly relaxed gun laws could open the door for the guilty to walk away without consequence. Consider another gun-toting observer of the hypothetical fist fight, who is an enemy of one of the combatants. He could easily hide behind the claim that he reasonably believed that the other combatant was going to cause great bodily harm if the fight continued. The shooter could have every evil motive in the world, but so long as he stood behind the story that he reasonably believed the other person could suffer great bodily harm or death, then he could conceivably  walk. When guns are permitted in every public place and are mixed with such an obtusely written statute, a puzzling and perplexing standard of behavior regarding the use of guns occurs. This becomes a recipe for disaster and death. Gun laws and the stand your ground law need to be re-evaluated and addressed responsibly very soon.  If we don't learn lessons from the Trayvon Martin tragedy, then we are doomed to see similar events happen. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark NeJame.",
         "Mark NeJame: Combination of guns and \"stand your ground\" laws are dangerous .\nHe says laws enable people to use deadly force even if they're not at risk .\n\"Castle doctrine\" justifies use of deadly force to protect yourself in your home, he says .\nNeJame: Extending the castle doctrine everywhere raises questions .",

         "Washington (CNN) -- President Obama will announce the U.S. troop strategy for Afghanistan in a speech at 8 p.m. ET Tuesday at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Wednesday. In the speech, Obama will explain why the United States is in Afghanistan, its interests there and his decision-making process, Gibbs said, but \"the president does not see this as an open-ended engagement. \"Our time there will be limited, and I think that's important for people to understand,\" he said. \"We are in year nine\" in Afghanistan, Gibbs told reporters. \"We're not going to be there another eight or nine years.\" Obama will meet with members of Congress at the White House on Tuesday afternoon before the speech. Cost issues are among the topics the president will address, Gibbs said. \"It's a million dollars a troop for a year,\" he said. \"Ten thousand troops is $10 billion. That's in addition to what we already spend in Afghanistan and Pakistan. That also does not include training, and it doesn't include the maintaining of a security force. It's very, very, very expensive.\" But, Gibbs added, \"I think the president, throughout this process, has talked about the cost in terms of American lives and in terms of the cost to our treasury, and I think he'll continue to talk about it.\" The president ordered more than 20,000 additional troops to Afghanistan in March. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, reportedly has called for up to 40,000 more to wage a counterinsurgency campaign against the Taliban, the Islamic militia originally ousted by U.S. military action in 2001. Obama has weighed several options for bolstering the American contingent, ranging from sending a few thousand troops to the 40,000 McChrystal requested. A defense official told CNN earlier this week the Pentagon is making detailed plans to send about 34,000 more troops to Afghanistan in anticipation of Obama's decision on the 8-year-old war. There had been no final word on Obama's decision as of Tuesday, said the Defense Department official, who has direct knowledge of the process. But the official said planners have been tasked with preparing to send 34,000 additional American troops to Afghanistan with the expectation that Obama was leaning toward approving that many. iReporters sound off; share your views on sending more troops in Afghanistan . Defense Secretary Robert Gates is expected to receive the paperwork Thursday to approve orders to deploy 1,000 Marines from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, to Afghanistan in late December -- the first of the new troops to be sent, a U.S. military official told CNN on Wednesday. The official is not authorized to talk about the plans because they have not been officially announced. The 1,000 Marines are part of a battalion task force that has been preparing and training for the deployment, the official said. The president held a lengthy meeting with top advisers Monday night, and he told reporters Tuesday that he would announce new plans for Afghanistan after Thanksgiving. McChrystal took part in the meeting Monday, along with Vice President Joe Biden, Gates, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen and Karl Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador in Kabul, Afghanistan. Obama said Tuesday that the deliberations had been \"comprehensive and extremely useful.\" \"It's going to be important to recognize that in order for us to succeed there [in Afghanistan], you've got to have a comprehensive strategy that includes civilian and diplomatic efforts,\" he said at a news conference Tuesday with visiting Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The defense official said Tuesday that the military is planning to send three U.S. Army brigades, totaling about 15,000 troops; a Marine brigade with about 8,000 troops; a headquarters element of about 7,000; and between 4,000 and 5,000 support troops -- a total of about 34,000 troops. CNN reported last month that this was the Pentagon's preferred option. However, the official said Wednesday that the Marines are expected to deploy 8,000 combat, aviation and support troops, plus 1,000 to 1,500 Marines as part of a headquarters unit -- a total of between 9,000 and 9,500. They will be in addition to the 11,000 Marines already in Afghanistan. After the first deployment, the remaining Marines will deploy over the next three to four months, the military official said. The troops would be dispatched throughout Afghanistan but would be focused mainly on the southern and southeastern provinces, where much of the recent fighting has taken place. Currently, brigades from Fort Drum in upstate New York and Fort Campbell in Kentucky are among those next in line to deploy. About 68,000 U.S. troops are in Afghanistan, along with about 45,000 from the NATO alliance. Two U.S. military officials have told CNN that NATO countries would be asked to contribute more troops to fill the gap between the 34,000 the Pentagon expects Obama to send and the 40,000 McChrystal wants. The request is expected to come during a December 7 meeting at the alliance's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will travel to Brussels next week to meet with allies, State Department sources told CNN. Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell would not discuss specific numbers, but he said NATO would be asked for additional help. Obama's Afghanistan plan will include \"very broad terms\" that show how and where the United States is succeeding in the nation, a senior U.S. military official told CNN. Those points will be used to determine how and when troops can be brought home. Another senior military official said McChrystal will take his orders from Obama and will do the best he can with what he has. The question, he said, is not the number of troops, but is whether the United States has \"the right resources to do what we need to do.\" \"We can't just go and blow people up and win this war,\" the official said. \"We have to gain the trust of the people, and that is a major part of the plan here.\" U.S.-led troops invaded Afghanistan in response to the al Qaeda terrorist network's September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. The invasion overthrew the ruling Taliban, which had allowed al Qaeda to operate from its territory -- but most of the top al Qaeda and Taliban leadership escaped the onslaught. Taliban fighters have since regrouped to the mountainous region along Afghanistan's border with Pakistan, battling U.S. and Afghan government forces on one side and Pakistani troops on the other. Al Qaeda's top leaders, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, remain at large and are suspected to be hiding in the same region. The conflict has so far claimed the lives of more than 900 Americans and nearly 600 allied troops. CNN's Jill Dougherty, Deirdre Walsh, Elaine Quijano and Mike Mount contributed to this report.",

         "(CNN) -- Waking to another cloudless morning, you dive off your houseboat into the wild blue of Lake Powell in southern Utah. The water takes the edge off the heat, and you float along, contemplating a lazy day of navigating spectacular red-rock gorges and flooded canyons. Brian Raub, founder of Lakelubbers.com, says lakes have an inherent advantage over the ocean when it comes to vacations. \"You'll probably prefer the feel of freshwater over salt, and you probably won't miss seasickness, seaweed or sharks. You can choose your outdoor temperatures; lakes exist at elevations from below sea level to 13,000 feet above.\" See more of America's best lakes . And temperature isn't your only choice: America offers a lake vacation for every season and activity, and no matter where you live, even in the Southwest desert, chances are there's one near you. Satellite mapping has yet to yield a precise answer, but the best guess is that there are between 3 and 4 million lakes across the U.S., ranging from duck ponds to wonders like Oregon's Crater Lake. While Lake Tahoe is most popular for winter sports and Wisconsin's Lake Winnebago reaches its windsurfing peak in fall, we associate most lakes with summer, as places to cool off and chill out. A recent study by ResortsandLodges.com named lake vacations the most popular summer travel trend of 2012, ahead of beach vacations, romantic getaways, and family trips.

         "Hong Kong (CNN) -- Japan and Australia are exchanging harsh words and threats of legal action in a dispute over a whaling incident near Antarctica. Environment Minister Tony Burke is threatening to take Japan to international court, claiming a Japanese whaling fleet attacked Australian ships on Wednesday. But in the Japanese version of what happened, it's the Australians who deserve court sanctions. \"Japan needs to stop this once and for all,\" Burke told Australia's Seven Network on Thursday. \"What we are watching and what we've been seeing Japan do in that Southern Ocean year on year now is just disgusting. No other way of describing it. Now, as a government we don't settle it in the car park, we settle in the court,\" he said. \"There's been the most outrageous attack on the Sea Shepherd Australia ships,\" said Bob Brown, a member of the board of directors of Sea Shepherd Australia, describing it as the \"worst incident\" the anti-whaling group had experienced since one of its vessels sank two years ago. In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), Brown said that a large Japanese factory ship, the Nisshin Maru, had repeatedly rammed Sea Shepherd ships in the Southern Ocean near Antarctica where it was trying to refuel and that a Japanese government escort vessel had directed water cannon and lobbed concussion grenades at the activists. He claimed the Japanese ships had intruded into Australian territorial waters and breached international and Australian law. \"I'm very concerned and alarmed that Japan has decided to become pirates in our territorial waters,\" he said. \"It's time the Australian government acted.\" Burke told Seven Network it's not that simple. \"In terms of sending in the Navy, you've got to make sure you don't have a response here that blows up a whole lot of other things. The reason -- even though they're our territorial waters -- we don't assert that. And that's part of the whole Antarctic Treaty System, which prevents mining in Antarctica. You don't want to blow up that system,\" he explained. \"I've got to say with that court case we are now getting very close. It has been too long. We are now getting very close on that. But I'm not going to take an action that blows up the Antarctic Treaty System either,\" Burke said. \"What we will do, though, is take the action that we've taken already with the International Court of Justice to [expose] that this gimmick that they've got -- claiming that's its scientific whaling, when everybody knows that's a con.\" Japan annually hunts whales despite a worldwide moratorium, utilizing a loophole in the law that allows for killing the mammals for scientific research. Whale meat is commonly available for consumption in Japan. Each year, environmental groups such as Sea Shepherd face off with Japan's hunters in a high seas drama that has led to collisions of ships, the detaining of activists and smoke bombs fired back and forth between the groups. The Japan Fisheries Agency's Institute of Cetacean Research disputed the Australian claims in a statement. The ICR says three Sea Shepherd ships sailed recklessly and abnormally close to the Nisshin Maru and its fueling ship during a refueling operation on Wednesday. Although the Nisshin Maru tried to ward off the Australian ships with loud speakers and water cannons, the Sea Shepherd ships' \"extreme dangerous\" acts halted the refueling operation, the ICR said. During the process, the three Australian ships bumped the Nisshin Maru at least four times, causing some damage, the ICR said. The Japanese agency said it's considering filing a third claim in a U.S. court for Sea Shepherd's \"insults against the court authority.\" According to ICR, Sea Shepherd has been banned from threatening whaling ships' operations or sailing within 500 yards of whaling ships.

Han Lei, 39, was charged with intentional homicide over the death of the two-year-old girl who died in hospital from brain damage 50 hours after being dashed to the pavement in the Daxing District of Beijing on July 23. The court sentenced his friend Li Ming, who helped Han escape after the incident, to five years' jail. The Beijing No.1 Intermediate People's Court heard how Han and Li decided to drive to a karaoke bar after a dinner with several other people. Unable to find a parking space, they attempted to park at a bus stop where a woman, also surnamed Li, was waiting with the 2-year, 10-month-old baby who was named as Sun in court documents. An altercation began when Han accused the mother of blocking the car's path with the pushchair. The court heard how Han hit the mother and then proceeded to hurl the baby out of its pram. The court rejected his defense that he had been intoxicated at the time of the attack, saying that his mental condition had been \"stable\" despite earlier drinking at dinner. Prosecutors recommended that Han, who committed the crime within a year of being released from prison, be given the death sentence. \"I smacked her in the face. She hit back, too. People started to gather around us. I just wanted to smash the trolley,\" Han reportedly said in a statement to police. The girl's mother told police that Han had earlier threatened to kill the child and had acted before she was able to take measures to protect her. Han fled the scene with Li Ming, who was charged with harboring a criminal, but was arrested by police the next day. Li turned himself in to police on July 25. Relatives of the child asked for a total of 2.73 million yuan ($443,513) in civil compensation during the court hearing, according to state-run Xinhua. The case drew a strong response on Chinese social media site Weibo where posters mostly applauded the death sentence: \"He deserves to be shot 100 times,\" said poster Xiongwoxi while another, named as Wujiayounvchuzhangcheng, said the death sentence was not strong enough. \"Dying once is leniency,\" he said. Despite this, there were some calls to end capital punishment in China. \"Although he deserves the death, shouldn't we give him another chance? Do we must have people die one after another?\" said poster Linxidaxuesonglianli.",

         "(CNN) -- A Pennsylvania court has ordered that the juvenile trial of Jordan Brown -- a boy accused of killing his father's pregnant girlfriend three years ago -- be closed, despite a push by several newspapers to allow public access. Brown was 11 in February 2009 when, authorities say, he shot Kenzie Marie Houk, 26, once at point-blank range in her western Pennsylvania farmhouse. She was eight months pregnant at the time. He was initially charged as an adult, facing the prospect of life in prison without parole. But on August 23, 2011, Lawrence County Judge Dominick Motto reversed his earlier ruling so that Brown would instead face a juvenile proceeding. A judge later ordered that these upcoming proceedings must be closed to the public. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Pittsburgh Tribune-Review and New Castle News newspapers subsequently filed an appeal, arguing that the public has a constitutional right to access the courts even when juveniles are involved. Pennsylvania's Superior Court issued a 33-page ruling on Wednesday, that was obtained Friday by InSession from CNN's sister network truTV, regarding the appeal. The opinion, written by Judge Jacqueline Shogan, acknowledges that there \"has been some recent tendency to permit publicity (of) juvenile court proceedings on the theory that this will act as a curb to juvenile delinquency.\" But the court also expressed concerns that the harm caused by publicizing juvenile proceedings \"may be great.\" The order references an effort to maintain Jordan's privacy, finding that \"there is no alternative short of closure of the juvenile court proceedings\" that will do so. \"Closure of the juvenile proceedings, under the constitutional analysis, serves a compelling government interest and ... there is no less restrictive means to serve that interest,\" Shogan wrote in the opinion. Given the high-profile nature of the case, CNN is identifying Brown by name even though he is a juvenile. Investigators say Houk was killed with a bullet fired from a youth model 20-gauge shotgun that belonged to Brown. The pregnant woman's 4-year-old daughter found her in her bed, according to police. The girl alerted landscapers working near the home, who then called authorities. Brown, who was living with his father at the time of the shooting, was subsequently charged with one count each of criminal homicide and homicide of an unborn child. The charges were initially filed in an adult court because, according to Pennsylvania state law, anyone older than 10 who has committed a murder or homicide is automatically tried as an adult. The defense then must present a sufficient case to move a case to juvenile court. At the time, Brown was thought to be the youngest person facing a life sentence without the possibility of parole, according to an Amnesty International statement. InSession's Jessica Thill contributed to this report.",

         "Istanbul (CNN) -- The latest ISIS advance in Syria has brought a swath of the country's north-central Kurdish region under siege, with Kurdish leaders warning of another humanitarian crisis without international intervention. The Syrian Kurdish town of Kobani (Ayn al-Arab in Arabic) is an island, surrounded by ISIS on three fronts and the Turkish border to the north. The town was already mostly blockaded by ISIS, but in the past three days some 60 nearby villages fell under ISIS control, according to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or \"Islamic State,\" as the group calls itself, took 39 villages on Friday alone as Kurdish forces withdrew from their positions, the Observatory said. Clashes are constant around Kobani as Kurdish fighters attempt to hold off ISIS, which is armed with heavy artillery and tanks, Kurdish activist Mostafa Baly told CNN. \"Mobilization of people in Kobani is not enough,\" said Redur Xelil, a spokesman for the Kurdish fighters. \"The international community has to take action. If not, there will be a new (Sinjar) genocide, but this time in Kobani.\" Sinjar is the Iraqi city that came under ISIS attack last month, causing thousands to flee onto adjacent Mount Sinjar, where refugees became stranded and were starving before U.S. airstrikes helped pave a way for them to flee. The fighting around Kobani has been intense for four days, Xelil told CNN. Masoud Barzani, the President of the Kurdish Region in Iraq, called the ISIS attacks in northern Syria \"barbaric\" and described them as ethnic cleansing. \"I ask the international community to take every measure as soon as possible to save Kobani and the people of Syrian Kurdistan from the terrorists,\" he said in a statement. \"The ISIS terrorists perpetrate crimes and atrocities wherever they are, therefore they have to be hit and defeated wherever they are.\" As ISIS encroached on the nearby villages, residents fled toward Kobani, said Baly, the Kurdish activist. There were reports that ISIS kidnapped some of those fleeing to Kobani, including women, children and the elderly, Baly said. At least three rockets landed in Kobani, causing much panic, he said. \"There is a great deal of fear, but people are insisting on standing up to ISIS and remaining steadfast in the face of their attack,\" he said. Turkey opens border . The fear of a humanitarian crisis in Kobani rose as displaced people sought refuge there but became trapped between the fighting and the Turkish border. An estimated 3,000 to 4,000 Kurds fleeing the violence walked right up to the wire border fence with Turkey, where they initially were not allowed in. They just sat at the border as Turkish Kurds on the other side of the fence tried to persuade the Turkish guards to let them in. The situation on the border could be observed on a live feed from the border and from video footage aired on Turkish news outlets. The refugees also tried to force their way into Turkey, creating chaos as one woman stepped on a landmine. Turkey finally opened the border, relieving some of the mounting pressure in Kobani and allowing refugees to enter Sanliurfa province. \"Four thousand of our siblings will be hosted in our country,\" Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told state media. \"Opening our arms to our Syrian brothers is our historic humanitarian responsibility.\" Hosting Syrian refugees is nothing new for Turkey and other neighboring nations. About 815,000 registered Syrian refugees were in Turkey as of last month, part of the 3 million total registered Syrian refugees that the U.N. has counted amid Syria's three-year civil war. A further 6.5 million people were believed to be displaced within Syria as of last month, according to the U.N. U.S. military on deck . The U.S. Senate on Thursday voted overwhelmingly to approve the arming of Syrian rebels as top U.S. military leadership approved a plan to strike ISIS in Syria. The House approved Obama's request Wednesday. The approval allows President Barack Obama to carry out part of his stated strategy to combat ISIS, though some political leaders remain divided on the way forward. With approval in hand to arm and train Syrian rebels to fight ISIS, Obama said Thursday the plan keeps with \"the key principle\" of U.S. strategy: No American combat troops on the ground. \"The American troops deployed to Iraq do not and will not have a combat mission,\" he said in televised remarks from the White House. \"Their mission is to advise and assist our partners on the ground. ... We can destroy ISIL without having our troops fight another ground war in the Middle East.\" Obama said more than 40 countries, including Arab nations, have offered assistance in the battle against ISIS. Long vetting and training process . National Security Adviser Susan Rice, speaking to reporters Friday, said that now that approval to arm moderate Syrian rebels has been given, a long process will start to vet and train those who will be benefit from the measure. U.S. military personnel will train the Syrian fighters outside of Syria, and the process of planning the training and vetting the participants will take months, she said. \"This is a serious training program, and we are serious about vetting those we are training and equipping,\" she said. Rice stepped around questions about whether airstrikes against ISIS in Syria will require an additional thumbs-up from President Obama, repeating the President's own announcement that the United States is \"prepared\" to broaden its actions in the region into Syria. ISIS videos . The advance by ISIS in northern Syria comes as the Islamist group released a 55-minute English-language video warning America against \"direct confrontation.\" The video describes the conflict as a fight between believers and nonbelievers, and praises its successes on the battlefield. Earlier this week, ISIS released another video showing a captive British journalist criticizing the American and British governments. Citing the Sunni terror group's brutality, from beheading civilians -- including American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff -- to the mass execution of its opponents, Obama said the United States will not back down. \"With their barbaric murder of two Americans, these terrorists thought they could frighten us or intimidate us or cause us to shrink from the world,\" Obama said. \"But today, they are learning the same hard lesson of petty tyrants and terrorists who have gone before: As Americans, we do not give in to fear. When you harm our citizens, when you threaten the United States, when you threaten our allies, it doesn't frighten us. It unites us.\" The question now appears to be not if, but when, the United States will strike ISIS in its stronghold in northern Syria. The U.S. military has everything it needs to strike ISIS targets in Syria, a plan that officials told CNN is still waiting on Obama's signoff. ISIS, meanwhile, is modifying its behavior, from the way it communicates to the way it conceals itself, in response to potential U.S. airstrikes in Syria, U.S. military officials told CNN. The officials expressed confidence the airstrikes would be effective. Gul Tuysuz reported from Istanbul, and Mariano Castillo wrote and reported from Atlanta.

         "WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Sen. Mel Martinez, a Florida Republican, announced Friday that he will resign his seat as soon as a replacement can be named by the governor. Sen. Mel Martinez is the only Hispanic Republican in the U.S. Senate. \"My priorities have always been my faith, my family and my country, and, at this stage of my life and after nearly 12 years of public service in Florida and in Washington, it is time to return to Florida and my family,\" the 62-year-old said in Orlando, Florida. \"So today I am announcing my decision to step down from public office.\" Martinez said he is resigning \"of my own free will. There is no impending reason; it's only my desire to move on and to get on with the rest of my life.\" He added that he is in good health and that he expects the next phase of his life will take place in the private sector. \"However, I do hope that I can have a voice to speak out on issues I think are important,\" he said. Martinez added that he has no plans to run for any other public office. At a news conference at McDill Air Force Base in Florida, Gov. Charlie Crist said he will \"undertake a very thorough, comprehensive, thoughtful process\" to find a replacement for Martinez. He vowed not to appoint himself to complete Martinez's six-year term, which ends in about 17 months, and predicted that he would reach a decision before the Senate returns from recess September 8. Crist, a Republican, had announced in May that he would not seek a second term as governor and instead would run for Martinez's seat in the 2010 election. Martinez was elected in 2004. He announced in December his intention to retire at the end of his term. Martinez is the only Hispanic Republican in the Senate. He joined eight other Republicans on Thursday in voting to confirm Judge Sonia Sotomayor as the first Hispanic justice to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. Democrats hold a tenuous filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, with 60 votes. Martinez is one of six Republicans who have stated they would not seek re-election in 2010. But the Florida senator is the second Republican who has decided to leave before the curtain drops on the 111th Congress next fall. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, recently announced her intention to quit the Senate three years before her term expires, in order to run for governor next year. The five other Republicans who are retiring are Missouri Sen. Kit Bond, Kansas Sen. Sam Brownback, New Hampshire Sen. Judd Gregg, Kentucky Sen. Jim Bunning and Ohio Sen. George Voinovich. Two Democrats will not run in 2010: Illinois Sen. Roland Burris and Delaware Sen. Ted Kaufman. Republicans must defend 19 seats next year, and Democrats must protect 18.

         "(CNN) -- A first half goal from Milan Jovanovic gave Serbia a shock 1-0 win over 10-man Germany at the World Cup on Friday to throw Group D wide open. Germany suffered an early blow in Port Elizabeth when leading striker Miroslav Klose was sent off for his second yellow card, shortly before Jovanovic fired Serbia in front. Lukas Podolski then saw his second half penalty, given following a handball by Nemanja Vidic, blocked by Serbian goalkeeper Vladimir Stojkovic. The result was perennial challengers Germany's first defeat at the group stage of a World Cup tournament since 1986, when then-West Germany were beaten by Denmark. That year, the three-times world champions went on to reach the final. It also marked the latest setback for the tournament's traditional giants following Switzerland's win over Spain and Mexico's win over France. German coach Joachim Loew admitted it was a big setback for his team. \"We had a lot of problems, the double yellow card for Klose, they got the first goal, then we failed to score from the penalty spot -- all in all it was difficult to come to terms with all this, \" he told AFP. \"We're devastated of course but I'm still confident we will go through to the last 16. we have our fate in our own hands still and a good goal difference.\" The result lifts Serbia's chances of qualifying from group D following their 1-0 defeat by Ghana in their opening game. They are now tied with Germany on three points following the Germans' 4-0 win over Australia. A win for Ghana over Australia on Saturday would put the west African side firmly on course for a place in the last 16 -- while a win for Australia would leave all four teams tied on three points . Match winner Jovanovic turned in Nikola Zigic's header from close range following good work down the right by the impressive Milos Krasic on 38 minutes. Two minutes earlier, Germany had been reduced to 10 men when Klose picked up his second yellow card of the game for a clumsy challenge on Dejan Stankovic. Klose, who is chasing Brazilian striker Ronaldo's record of 15 goals in World Cup tournaments, had earlier been booked for catching Branislav Ivanovic's ankles, and suspension will now rule him out of Germany's final group game against Ghana on June 23. But Klose appeared to be a victim of some fussy refereeing by Spanish official Alberto Undiano Mallenco, with seven other players also picking up bookings for minor offences. Germany came close to equalizing in the last minute of the half following a series of corners when Sami Khedira slammed a shot against the bar but Serbia's defenders scrambled away the rebound. Serbia, one of Europe's most impressive sides in World Cup qualifying, had seemed happy to concede possession and defend deep in the early stages with German midfielders Khedira and Mehsut Ozil struggling to find space in the center. Podolski flashed an early volley wide of the Serbian goal and Thomas Mueller combined neatly with Bastian Schweinsteiger on 30 minutes to play in Klose, but the German striker was called offside before putting the ball into the net. Serbia's main threat came from Krasic down the right, with Holger Badstuber and Philipp Lahm both picking up bookings for fouls on the CSKA Moscow midfielder. Aleksandar Kolarov went close from the second of those, clipping a freekick from the edge of the penalty area just wide of the post. Germany pressed hard for an equalizer early in the second half and looked to be back in the game when Serbian defender Nemanja Vidic was punished for a handball in the penalty area in a virtual repeat of the incident that saw his side concede a penalty in their opening defeat by Ghana. But Podolski's low shot was solidly blocked by goalkeeper Vladimir Stojkovic diving to his left. Podolski had already twice gone close, flashing a shot across the goal from Ozil's defense-splitting pass and then shooting into the side netting after being set up by the same player. Serbia almost increased their lead on 66 minutes when the ever dangerous Krasic cut in from the left to set up Jovanovic but the striker's low placed shot bounced to safety off the inside of the post. Zigic then glanced the top of the bar with a header, again from a cross from the right by Krasic.",

         "(CNN) -- Defending champions Inter Milan continued their march up the Italian Serie A table, beating 10-man Roma 5-3 in a thriller at the San Siro. Samuel Eto'o scored twice, with the returning Wesley Sneijder, Thiago Motta and Esteban Cambiasso also on target as Leonardo's side moved up to third place in the table, five points behind leaders Milan but with a game in hand. Inter took a third minute lead when Sneijder fired home an unstoppable shot after collecting Maicon's pass but Roma levelled 10 minutes later when Simplicio turned in Marco Cassetti's cross. However, the home side went into the break 2-1 ahead when Eto'o fired a shot that slipped through the hands of goalkeeper Sergio. The game turned Inter's way early in the second half when Nicolas Burdisso was sent after fouling Giampaolo Pazzini in the area and Eto'o stroked home the penalty to take his season's tally to 27 goals in all competitions. And Inter Milan increased their lead even further when Motta headed home from close range. However, Roma fought back and Mirko Vucinic pulled one back when diverting home Daniele De Rossi's free-kick and they reduced the deficit to 4-3 when Simone Loria prodded home from close range after Juan's header struck the post. But there was to be no dramatic comeback and Inter secured their victory through Cambiasso's late goal. Milan dropped two points after behind held to a 1-1 draw at Genoa, despite Pato giving them a 29th minute lead from close range. However, Antonio Floro Flores levelled on the stroke of half time when he was on hand to fire home after Mathieu Flamini deflected the ball into his path.

         "NEW YORK (CNN) -- Two customers are suing Wal-Mart for negligence after being injured in a mad rush for post-Thanksgiving bargains that left one store employee dead, the men's attorney said Tuesday. A temporary worker at this Wal-Mart was crushed to death when shoppers rushed into the store last week. Temporary Wal-Mart worker Jdimytai Damour, 34, was crushed to death as he and other employees attempted to unlock the doors of a store on Long Island at 5 a.m. Friday. Attorney Kenneth Mollins said Fritz Mesadieu and Jonathan Mesadieu were \"literally carried from their position outside the store\" and are now \"suffering from pain in their neck and their back from being caught in that surge of people\" that rushed into the Wal-Mart. New York Newsday reported that the Mesadieus are father and son, ages 51 and 19. The lawsuit alleges that the Mesadieus' injuries were a result of \"carelessness, recklessness, negligence.\" In a claim against the Nassau County police department, the men also contend that they \"sustained monetary losses as a result of health care and legal expenses ... in the sum of $2 million.\" \"This is a tragic situation that could have and should have been avoided with the exercise of reasonable care. There are very simple measures that could have been put in place to avoid this, such as barriers along the line to spread people out, extra security and a better police presence,\" Mollins said. He said his clients and others who were at the scene contend that the police \"were there ... saw what was happening, and they left.\" Calls seeking comment from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. were not immediately returned. Lt. Kevin Smith of the Nassau County Police Department said, \"it's our policy that we don't comment on open litigations\" and would not respond directly to Mollins and his clients' claim that officers left the scene. He said it is \"incumbent upon the store to provide security\" but noted that there was no security force present when officers responded to an initial phone call after 3 a.m. Friday for an unknown disturbance at the site. Smith said the officers noticed a lack of order with the crowd and began to organize them into a line, remaining on site for about 30 minutes until the crowd had become orderly. Throughout the morning, officers went back to check on the crowd and continued to notice no disturbance, Smith said. He said that there were no additional calls for assistance until about 5 a.m., when people began rushing the doors of the store and trampled Damour. An autopsy showed that Damour died of asphyxiation after being trampled, Nassau County officials have said. Video showed that as many as a dozen people were knocked to the floor in the stampede of people trying to get into the store. The employee was \"stepped on by hundreds of people\" as other workers attempted to fight their way through the crowd, said Nassau County Police Detective Lt. Michael Fleming.

         "Washington (CNN) -- For most divers, a shark in the water can inspire fear, or even dread. Greg Marshall wanted to hitch a ride. More specifically, Marshall was inspired by the shark's constant companion, a remora -- a torpedo-shaped fish that commonly catches a ride by sucking onto the shark's rough skin and thriving on the shark's leftovers. Marshall thought to himself: What if you had a camera as small as a remora? What if you could stick a camera on a shark so that the shark goes about its life, unaware that its actions were being recorded away from the distractions of photographers in scuba suits? Where would it go, and what would you see? For a naturalist, being able to observe animal behavior without interfering with the world the animal inhabits by the simple act of being there is the gold standard. In scientific terms, it's similar to a control in an experiment. But that goal is usually unobtainable -- observing how an animal acts in captivity, for example, is no indication of how an animal actually behaves. Observing that behavior in the wild, Marshall says, is equally problematic. \"When we're in an animal's habitat, they know we're there,\" he says. \"And they're reacting to us.\" And knowledge of an animal's actual behavior, Marshall says, is absolutely critical to reaching the correct conclusions about a creature's habitat and behavior, and how humans may be disrupting both. Of course, the best way to observe real behavior in the wild is to have omniscient powers of observation, or perhaps a camera lens as long as your arm and as expensive as a new car. Or you can see what the animal sees, courtesy of \"Crittercam.\" Twenty-five years after that underwater epiphany in the waters off Belize, Marshall and his far-flung team of naturalists and engineers are getting closer to that gold standard. Technology may finally be catching up with inspiration. Marshall took his initial ideas for ride-along observation technology to the National Geographic Society in 1987. Now he's vice president of the society's Remote Imaging division -- an effort by a team of scientists and engineers working with researchers around the globe capturing footage of how animals behave in the wild, away from the interference of the observers. \"Crittercam enables us to get out of the picture entirely -- to ride along, almost completely unobtrusively, to see their world and their behavior,\" he says. Marshall is a real-deal explorer, a tall, lanky, gregarious type who seems more suited to a dive boat in the Sea of Cortez or a snowmobile in Antarctica than an impressively equipped machine shop in the basement of the fabled headquarters of the National Geographic Society. Marshall still gets more than his fair share of exploration -- a day after this interview, he was off to Antarctica, again. But more often he's back in Washington, at his desk or in an edit bay. Still, adventure is where you find it -- and sometimes, it's in the most unlikely of places. Cracking open a newly recovered Crittercam remora (or box, or sphere, or whatever device his crew of happily mad scientists invent to capture hitherto-unwitnessed moments in nature) is, for Marshall, full of the rush of exploration. When Crittercam got its start, the results of all the hard work came down to a small, fragile tape. Nowadays, the data is stored on a tough, solid-state memory card. But seeing the data of the first time, Marshall says, is always a rush. \"You start looking at the screen because you never know what you're going to see. It's completely engaging and captivating,\" he says. The results, Marshall says, run the gamut from inspiring and revelatory to downright boring -- at least, boring to a typical National Geographic Channel viewer. But to a marine biologist like Marshall, even the \"boring\" stuff can have stop-in-your-tracks potential. Case in point: Sperm whales. They are one of the deepest-diving species on the planet. Years ago, his crew successfully attached an advanced Crittercam to a diving sperm whale. \"The first 10 seconds are fascinating, because you see the whale diving down,\" Marshall says. \"And then it dives down into utter darkness. And then we're looking at a black screen for the next two hours.\" But that Crittercam was also equipped to record sound, as well as video. And in that utter blackness (sperm whales can dive almost two miles down), the Crittercam whale began a conversation with another whale -- a cascade of powerful, rapid-fire clicks. That whale conversation kept Marshall and his editors transfixed. It wasn't a made-for-TV moment, but it was yet more evidence that just about every deployment of the Crittercam system can reap unexpected rewards. In the frigid waters off Alaska, a Crittercam captured an intimate view of a humpback whale calf nursing. There's dizzying footage of a tree kangaroo (yes, there's a kangaroo that climbs trees) high in the jungle canopy of New Guinea. A sea lion in Australia plays with its food -- in this case, a hapless octopus. There's even a brief glimpse of a great white shark swimming at eye-popping speed, chasing an equally quick seal. \"You just never know what you're going to get -- it's just completely engaging,\" he says with a broad grin. Crittercam footage finds its way into many of National Geographic's nature programs. And the best Crittercam moments are a rare combination of good television and good science. That's partly the goal of the whole program, Marshall says. \"I want to find a way to connect with people, I want to find a way to make them care about the conservation problem,\" Marshall says. \"Imagine a planet where there are no humpback whales, where there are no blue whales, no leopard seals, no leatherback turtles. Can we survive? Absolutely we can survive... Well, probably. \"Is it going to be the kind of place we're going to revel in, that's going to inspire us? I doubt it. As we know more, we're going to care more -- and as we care more, we're going to protect these animals and the habitats they depend on.\"",

         "(CNN) -- Everything about Jupiter is super-sized, including its colorful, turbulent atmosphere. But there's fresh evidence that one of the planet's most recognizable features, the Great Red Spot, is shrinking. NASA's Cassini spacecraft photographed Jupiter and its Great Red Spot, seen center near the equator, in 2000. The spot, which is actually an ancient monster storm that measures about three Earths across, lost 15 percent of its diameter between 1996 and 2006, scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, have found. It shrank by about 1 kilometer (about 0.6 miles) a day during that time period, said Xylar Asay-Davis, a postdoctoral researcher who was part of the study. Astronomers have observed for years that the clouds of the Great Red Spot have been waning, but this newest research focused on the motion of the storm -- a much more reliable way to measure its size, Asay-Davis said. He and fellow Berkeley researchers Philip Marcus, Imke de Pater, Michael Wong and Sushil Shetty developed software that tracked the movement of the spot's cloud patterns over long periods of time. \"It's not just the motion of the spot as a whole object. Within it, it has a very complicated swirl to it -- sort of a thin ring on the outside and then a sort of quiet area in the center -- and that shape of it has been changing over time,\" Asay-Davis said. \"What we actually look at is where the winds are the strongest in the vortex. It's the ring where they're the strongest, and that ring has been shrinking over time.\" The findings have been submitted for publication in Icarus, the International Journal of Solar System Studies.  See photos of the other planets and find out what makes them stand out » . What makes it red? The researchers do not know why the storm is shrinking. In fact, little is known about the Great Red Spot at all. Even the exact cause of its distinctive color is a mystery. \"We don't actually know what causes any of the colors on Jupiter,\" said Amy Simon-Miller, chief of the Planetary Systems Lab at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"One of the leading theories is that [the storm] is dredging up stuff from much deeper below in the atmosphere that turns red when it's exposed to sunlight.\" The spot isn't always bright red; sometimes it's actually quite pale, Simon-Miller noted. Astronomers have been tracking it since the 1870s, said Glenn Orton, a senior research scientist at NASA'S Jet Propulsion Laboratory who investigates planetary atmospheres. It is possible that the spot may one day disappear, he added. \"It's just a storm that, like many things, has a natural growth and disintegration rate,\" Orton said. Astronomers see a dramatic difference in the spot's shape when comparing photos of Jupiter taken more than a century ago to recent images of the planet. Orton joked that the Great Red Spot used to be so long that its acronym should have stood for the \"Great Red Sausage.\" \"I just happened to look at an old picture and said to myself, 'That looks like a breakfast sausage.' It's very long. I mean, if you look at one of those pictures back from then and a picture now, you think, 'My God, this thing is going on a diet,\" Orton said. Now eye-shaped, the spot is expected to become circular by about 2040, he added. Chemical stew . The storm is a fascinating feature on a fascinating planet. It has some of the characteristics of a hurricane on Earth, including a circular motion and strong winds. They're Jupiter-strength inside the spot, with some gusting up to 400 miles per hour, Simon-Miller said. Unlike hurricanes on Earth, which are low-pressure systems, the Great Red Spot is a high-pressure system, so it's more stable -- one of the reasons it has lasted so long, she added. Another factor in its longevity is that there is no land on Jupiter to slow a storm in the way landfalls cause hurricanes to lose steam on Earth. Jupiter's atmosphere of colorful dots, swirls and bands may look like an impressionist painting from above, but it would quickly lose its beauty on closer approach. The clouds visible from space consist of ammonia ice and ammonium hydrosulfide -- a sort of smoggy chemical stew -- and the conditions below are brutal, especially inside the Great Red Spot. \"The winds are so strong, everything would get pulled apart pretty quickly. There's no surface to stand on and look up at it,\" Simon-Miller said. Probes sent by NASA towards the interior of the planet have been crushed by the gas giant's enormous atmospheric pressure. Still, the images of Jupiter and its Great Red Spot mesmerize astronomers. \"The pictures are just so beautiful, and they're different every single time we look,\" Simon-Miller said.",

         "Phoenix, Arizona (CNN) -- By now, the entire country has gotten the message that Arizonans are angry and frustrated over illegal immigration. But, oddly enough, the anger and frustration isn't usually aimed at the illegal immigrants themselves. Many Arizonans would probably admit that, if they were unable to feed their families in their home country, they too might venture out in search of employment. And, if they were faced with waits of 10 to 15 years to enter another country legally, you can bet many of them would enter illegally. What really gets Arizonans fired up are three things: the feeling that they're under siege by spillover violence from Mexican drug cartels, the concern that the U.S. government isn't doing enough to protect them, and indignation that people in other states are judging them for responding to a reality most of us can't imagine. That's what you hear on talk radio and what you read in the letters section of local newspapers. And that's also pretty much the view of Jay Heiler, a top-notch political and public affairs consultant and a familiar fixture in Arizona Republican circles. Heiler served as chief of staff to former Gov. Fife Symington in the 1990s and counsels Gov. Jan Brewer today. He's a vocal defender of the state's new immigration law, Senate Bill 1070. What I wanted to know is whether that's because he really believes in the measure or whether he's just being a good soldier for the state GOP, given that just about every prominent Republican official in the state backs the law. As we met for what became a three-hour dinner in a Phoenix restaurant, I soon had my answer. Heiler began the conversation with a piece of advice. \"If you're going to write about this issue with credibility,\" he said, \"you have to acknowledge the reality of the violence caused by the Mexican drug cartels and the inability of the Mexican government to contain it.\" Not this again. The new bogeyman of the immigration debate is the Mexican drug cartels. In fact, when you engage a supporter of SB 1070, it's hard to get them to talk about anything else. The cartels are their strong card; why not play it? One of the arguments floating about -- advanced by Brewer -- is that most illegal immigrants act as drug mules for the cartels. Too bad Brewer can't seem to find anyone to back that up. Arizona Sen. John McCain said he doesn't believe that most illegal immigrants are used as drug mules. Neither does T.J. Bonner, head of the National Border Patrol Council, the labor union representing nearly 20,000 border patrol agents. Bonner said Brewer's claims are \"clearly not the case\" and \"don't comport with reality.\" Heiler is too smart to repeat wild claims. Instead, he stayed focused on public perception. He submits that most of the support for the measure --- polls show that about 55 percent of Arizonans back the law, down from 70 percent when Brewer signed it in April -- is coming from people who are sincerely afraid that Mexico is spinning out of control because of the drug war and that the chaos is spilling into Arizona in the form of kidnappings and other lawlessness. According to law enforcement authorities, in 2008, nearly 400 kidnappings happened in Phoenix. But a prosecutor told me that most people don't understand that many of these \"kidnappings\" aren't for ransom. Rather, they're an extension of the human smuggling industry, in which rival coyotes raid each other's \"drop houses\" and steal the cargo. That's a serious crime, and yet it's probably not what most people think about when they hear the word \"kidnapping.\" Phoenix Police Chief Jack Harris, a vocal opponent of the immigration law, insists that he has the manpower to investigate each kidnapping. But, he warns, that could change if the portions of SB 1070 struck down by a federal judge come back to life like the mythical bird that shares the city's name. If his officers have to make immigration enforcement their top priority, Harris said, other crimes will probably go unsolved. Then, the crime rate could soar. Right now, the crime rate in Phoenix is down. The Phoenix Police Department confirms it. \"Despite all the hype,\" spokesman Trent Crump told the Wall Street Journal, \"in every single reportable crime category, we're significantly down.\" In the first quarter of 2010, violent crime was down 17 percent in the city, while homicides were down 38 percent and robberies 27 percent, compared with the same time period in 2009. The  Federal Bureau of Investigation also confirms it. The number of violent crimes has fallen every year in Phoenix since 2006, the FBI reports. It's part of an overall trend in which, according to the bureau, crime rates are actually going down in cities that have large immigrant populations . It's pretty obvious that cynical politicians -- all of whom happen to be Republicans -- are exaggerating the fear factor to cover up what they recognize as some of the more unseemly motives of SB 1070 supporters. Although Heiler doesn't deny that some of the folks who have rallied around the law are motivated by anxiety over changing demographics, he wouldn't admit that this has anything to do with race and ethnicity. But isn't that obvious? For the past two decades, there has been a loud chorus of worry about how Latino immigrants are changing Phoenix -- and, according to some, not for the better. Those feelings didn't just go away. And the people who hold them are almost certainly part of the pro-1070 brigade. Not everyone who wants to get rid of illegal immigrants does so because he or she sees a connection to the drug cartels. In fact, most people just want to preserve the America they grew up with. Besides, if they really want to put drug dealers out of business, the best way is to support Mexican President Felipe Calderon, who has declared war on these criminal syndicates and yet vehemently opposes the Arizona law. Instead, Republican candidates for office are running TV ads in Arizona criticizing Calderon for criticizing the law. That makes absolutely no sense, just as it makes no sense for Arizona to crack down on illegal immigrants in the hopes that it will somehow get rid of drug dealers. Unless, of course, the real objective all along has been something much sneakier: to use the fear of drug dealers to get rid of illegal immigrants. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.",

         "Los Angeles (CNN) -- Fourteen mothers, whose children prosecutors say were sexually abused by a Los Angeles teacher facing 23 felony charges, sued the school district on Tuesday seeking damages for \"generalized shock and trauma.\" The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, also seeks unspecified \"compensatory economic and special damages for medical expenses,\" which include psychological therapy, according to court papers and attorneys for the plaintiffs. The suit also seeks reforms to the Los Angeles Unified School District, which \"has a practice and custom of maintaining a 'Culture of Silence' to hide teacher misconduct, and to ignore teacher misconduct,\" the suit said. The legal action stems from a criminal case against former teacher Mark Berndt of Miramonte Elementary, who is being held on $23 million bond and faces 23 felony counts of lewd acts on children. Berndt, 61, pleaded not guilty in February to allegations he bound young students, then photographed them with semen-filled spoons held at their mouths and three-inch cockroaches crawling across their faces, among other graphic depictions. L.A. schools review past 40 years of teacher discipline cases in misconduct crisis . The 23 victims were between 7 and 10 years old, and all but two of them were girls, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said. The 14 mothers' lawsuit says Berndt took photographs of their children \"with cookies in the mouths of plaintiff's children, and/or blindfolded the children, and/or placed cockroaches on the bodies of plaintiff's children, for the intent of arousing and gratifying the lust, passions and sexual desires of Mark Berndt.\" One of two mothers who spoke at a press conference on Tuesday said her now 10-year-old daughter was victimized by Berndt while a student at Miramonte from 2009 to 2010. CNN, which has interviewed the mother in recent months, isn't identifying the mother or other parents in order to protect the identities of the children. \"I am asking for justice and I want justice to be done to this man,\" the mother, 43, said. She wants the district to be held accountable for its \"negligence,\" she said. In a recent CNN interview, the mother said her daughter went to Berndt's classroom, where \"he would give her some cookies. My daughter told me that the teacher would say the cookies had sugar and some white stuff that was on it,\" the mother said. In that CNN interview, the mother was joined by her daughter, who told CNN: \"We would help him clean his class and he would give us cookies. \"They were white and they had a white stuff on top, and he would put some sort of powder\" on the cookie, the girl said. The parents told CNN they didn't tell their daughter what could have been on the cookie. The girl's father, 46, who joined his wife at Tuesday's press conference, told CNN the couple doesn't want money but rather justice, so other families won't \"suffer what's happening to us,\" the dad said. Their daughter is now enrolled at another school. The daughter and mother are both in counseling, he said. \"We don't want money, because our children's health physically and mentally is not going to be the same,\" the father said. California teacher pleads not guilt in student 'bondage' case . The other mother at Tuesday's press conference told reporters that her daughter is now rebellious and is also in counseling. Five of the children in the civil lawsuit are among the 23 alleged victims in the criminal case, said Luis A. Carrillo, the attorney for the 14 mothers. Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives are investigating the accusations of the nine other children identified as victims in the civil suit, Carrillo said. Sheriff's Lt. Carlos Marquez, the lead investigator in the case, said Tuesday that detectives interviewed more than 100 Miramonte students and have presented all those cases to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office for review. It's up to the district attorney whether to bring charges on behalf of additional victims, beyond the current 23, Marquez said. Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office, declined to comment Tuesday on whether additional charges would be filed. Berndt's attorney, public defender Victor Acevedo, declined to comment Tuesday because he hadn't seen the lawsuit. David Holmquist, general counsel for the Los Angeles school district, said student safety was the system's \"paramount priority.\" \"The district is committed to working with the Miramonte community and everyone impacted by these incidents to improve trust and promote healing,\" Holmquist said in a statement. \"While the district has yet to receive the latest complaint, we are continuing our efforts to ensure that we are doing everything possible to provide a safe learning and working environment for our students and staff.\" In May, another civil lawsuit was filed against the school district on behalf of 22 children who claimed they were sexually abused by Berndt, said Carrillo, who also is the attorney for the plaintiffs in that case. The lawsuit, also filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, alleged that Berndt \"engaged in sexual assault, sexual harassment, which includes sex discrimination per LAUSD's policies, and/or sexual exploitation of the plaintiffs that included lewd, obscene and/or lascivious acts\" with the 22 children age 6 to 9 years old between 2002 and 2011, court papers said. The children of the 14 mothers in Tuesday's lawsuit are also part of the May lawsuit, Carrillo said. In December 2010, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department began investigating Berndt after authorities learned of hundreds of \"questionable photographs of children on film that Mr. Berndt had brought (to) a local store to have developed,\" according to Tuesday's lawsuit. Berndt was removed from his teaching job in January 2011 after school officials learned of the police investigation, authorities said. Authorities have said they have discovered roughly 600 images allegedly taken by Berndt in his classroom. A teacher for 30 years, Berndt initially challenged the school district's decision to dismiss him. But he eventually dropped his appeal and resigned in spring 2011. His arrest in January led to broader fallout over the adequacy of safeguards for the school's students and the prospect of more victims. Days after Berndt was taken into custody, another Miramonte Elementary teacher -- Martin Springer, 49 -- was arrested and charged with three felony counts of lewd acts with a girl younger than 14. He has pleaded not guilty. The Los Angeles Unified School District board subsequently shut Miramonte for two days, during which the board reconstituted the entire staff in the 1,400-student school. Miramonte is in unincorporated Los Angeles County within the Florence-Firestone area, about six miles south of downtown Los Angeles.

         "(CNN) -- Standing just feet from the gunman in Monday's deadly Ohio school shooting, Danny Komertz has no doubt about what he saw. The Chardon High School freshman was walking with friends when they heard a loud pop. He looked up. \"I looked straight ahead and I saw a gun pointing at a group of four guys sitting a table ... He just fired two quick shots at them. I saw one student fall, and I saw the other hiding, trying to get cover underneath the table,\" Komertz told CNN. \"He was aiming right at them as he was two feet away ... He wasn't shooting around the cafeteria at all. He was directly aiming at the four of them,\" he said. Komertz was lucky; he wasn't hit. Five others were when a young man allegedly opened fire on that table of students in the Chardon High School cafeteria, killing one and seriously injuring four. Police arrested the suspected shooter a short time later. They have identified him as a juvenile, and witnesses told CNN the gunman was T.J. Lane, a student. Komertz, 15, said he heard some five shots -- the last two as he and his friends were running out the doors toward safety. \"I was very scared of what was going to happen so I didn't look at his face. I just looked at the gun and I ran,\" he said. Another witness, Nate Mueller, had his ear grazed by one of the gunman's bullets. He was sitting at a table next to the suspected shooter. \"All of a sudden we heard a loud bang, almost like a firework. We turned around and I saw T.J. standing at the table behind us with his gun pointed and firing,\" said Mueller. \"His first shot made me look. His second shot I watched him take, which hit somebody behind me, and his third shot hit me as I was turning away.\" Mueller described the gunman as stoic and silent. As he unloaded his weapon, his face was \"expressionless,\" Mueller said. \"There was no warning or anything. He just opened fire.\" Other students recalled being further away from the shooting, but no less scared. Josh Sophacak was walking outside the cafeteria when the first shot fired. \"It sounded like a firecracker ... I paused and everything went into slow motion from there. I guess I was in shock,\" he said. Yet for all the misery caused by Monday's shooting, witnesses have also described the makings of a hero. Assistant football coach and study hall teacher Frank Hall chased the gunman out of the school, they said. \"Coach Hall, he always talks about how much he cares about us students, his team and everyone. And I think today he really went out and he proved how much he cared about us. He would take a bullet for us,\" said Neil Thomas, a student. Thomas was in Spanish class when the gunshots started. An administrator came over an intercom system to announce a lock down, he said, sending teachers and students scurrying to the corners of rooms for cover. Sophacak similarly hailed the coach as \"heroic.\" Indeed, if not for Hall's quick response and the readiness of the school, which drills students on what to do in emergencies, Monday's death toll may have been much higher. \"As bad as it was already, I think it could have been a lot worse,\" said Evan Erasmus, a Chardon senior.",

         "Madrid (CNN) -- The \"fat one\" is about to get thinner. For the first time, big winners in Spain's annual Christmas lottery will have to pay a 20% tax on their winnings if the prize is greater than 2,500 euros, or $3,425. In Spain's deep economic crisis, the government started taxing all major lottery winnings in 2013 and expects to collect about $1 billion this year. On Sunday alone, in the annual Christmas lottery that will pay out about $3 billion in prize money, the government anticipates collecting tens of millions of dollars in taxes, the Treasury Ministry told CNN. Most of the prizes are relatively small, but the lucky ones holding part of the $875 million (640 million euro) first place prize, known as El Gordo -- \"the fat one\" -- will face the tax bite. A $27.40 (20 euro) lottery ticket that matches all the numbers of the first place El Gordo prize would win $548,000 (400,000 euros), but the winner would have to pay $109,000 (80,000 euros) in taxes, the Treasury Ministry said. Spaniards typically spend 20 euros or less to buy a share of a full ticket, trying to spread the purchase among friends or family, at the local bar or at the workplace. But Spain's economic crisis and unemployment rate, which still tops 25%, has not spared the lottery, whose intake has declined for five consecutive years, according to the Spanish Gaming Yearbook 2012-2013. The lottery officially began in 1892. Year after year, the biggest winner is the state, which keeps $1.3 billion -- or 30% -- of the entire lottery intake, which reached $4.3 billion this year. The remaining 70% is distributed for prizes.",

That was the defiant message from Barcelona's new president, who is adamant that the club's all-time leading goalscorer is going nowhere amid reports French club Paris St Germain want to sign the Argentine. Josep Maria Bartomeu will sit down with the four-time World Player of the Year to thrash out a new contract which will see him remain as most highly-paid at the Camp Nou. \"We want to sit down, without any rush, with Leo's father -- it's not something that's happening tomorrow, we have plenty of time, but we will do what we have to to ensure he's the best paid player,\" said Josep Maria Bartomeu, who assumed control at Barca after Sandro Rosell's resignation last week. Messi arrived at Barca in 2000 , graduating through the club's youth system before going on to establish himself as the best player on the planet. Since making his first team debut in 2004, Messi has helped the team win six Spanish league titles, two Spanish Cups and three European Champions League crowns. Blog: Is Ronaldo really the best? The club's determination to keep hold of Messi will be sweet relief to Barca fans after a turbulent few weeks. Former president Rosell stepped down after a Spanish judge's decision to investigate the deal which saw Neymar move to Catalonia from Brazilian team Santos last June. The club initially announced the deal was worth $78 million, but the breakdown of the agreement was never revealed. A Barcelona member launched a case against Rosell for not disclosing the full details and the club was asked by Spanish authorities to hand over documentation, as well as accounts for the past three years. Bartomeu, who will continue as president until the end of the current term, which finishes in 2016, explained that he spoke with senior players at the club before discussing details of Neymar's contract at a previous press conference. \"I explained to the captains that we would be showing details of Neymar's contract,\" said the former vice president. \"We have to be grateful to Neymar that he came here, when he could have earned more money at other clubs.\"",

         "(CNN) -- Federal authorities have launched a criminal investigation into the practices at the company linked to a fungal meningitis outbreak blamed for 23 deaths, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick told reporters Tuesday. In addition, the Board of Registration in Pharmacy has voted to revoke permanently the New England Compounding Center's license to operate in Massachusetts as well as the licenses of the company's three principal pharmacists, Patrick said. The announcements came in the wake of a damning nine-page report, released Tuesday by the board, which is part of the state's Department of Public Health. Investigators for the state's DPH, working with their counterparts at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, \"identified serious deficiencies and significant violations of pharmacy law and regulations that clearly placed the public's health at risk,\" it said. According to the investigator's preliminary findings, the Compounding Center: . -- Distributed large quantities of its products to facilities, \"apparently for general use rather than requiring a prescription for an individual patient\" as state law requires. -- Distributed two recalled lots of methylprednisolone acetate before it had learned the results of sterility tests. -- Did not follow proper sterilization standards. -- Produced vials of methylprednisolone that were later recalled that contained \"visible black particulate matter.\" -- Failed to thoroughly clean powder hoods, which are intended to protect pharmacists from inhaling substances while medication is being prepared, which \"may subsequently lead to contamination of compounded medications.\" -- Used \"visibly soiled\" mats outside \"clean rooms,\" potentially leading to their contamination. -- Failed to repair a leaking boiler adjacent to the clean room, which resulted in a pool of water around the boiler and adjacent walls creating an unsanitary condition. Patrick said the state would begin making unannounced inspections of pharmacies that prepare injectable medications and require that they submit annual reports detailing what they produce, how much of it and where it is distributed. \"It is now clear that the New England Compounding Center violated state law and endangered the health of countless patients,\" said U.S. Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Massachusetts, in a statement. The senior member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over the FDA, vowed to introduce legislation to improve safety of drugs made by compounding pharmacies. The incident began unfolding on September 24, when the department said it was notified about a cluster of six rare fungal meningitis cases in Tennessee. The patients shared several risk factors, including an epidural injection of a steroid -- methylprednisolone acetate 80 mg/ml preservative free -- that had been compounded at NECC in Framingham, Massachusetts. The department soon learned that the suspect product had been distributed to more than 14,000 patients in 23 states. Investigators arriving at the company on September 26 \"found NECC employees cleaning sterile compounding areas and and conducting environmental testing,\" the report says. \"DPH investigators also detected signs of bleach decontamination in the compounding areas.\" DPH has asked two other companies -- Ameridose and Alaunus Pharmaceutical -- to cease all pharmacy operations based on their shared ownership and leadership with New England Compounding Center. On October 15, federal authorities said that another NECC steroid injection, triamcinolone acetonide, might have caused a patient to acquire fungal meningitis, and they began contacting all 192 state facilities that received any NECC injectable products. Three days later, the FDA confirmed that sealed vials of methylprednisolone acetate had been contaminated with fungi. On Monday, the board authorized DPH staff to seek the permanent surrender of the licenses of the NECC principals, who are prohibited from practicing pharmacy throughout any appeals. \"NECC's transparency in dealing with the board since inception in 1998 demonstrates its good faith intention to operate in compliance with the requirements of its license,\" said Paul Cirel, a Boston-based lawyer representing the compounder, in a statement on Tuesday. \"Furthermore, the company's intention and best efforts at compliance are equally applicable in every other state in which it has been licensed.\" Tuesday's events came a day after the Food and Drug Administration posted on its website a list of more than 1,200 hospitals and clinics that it said had purchased drugs from the compounding center that, if contaminated, would be especially dangerous. But the agency took down the list after discovering inaccuracies. \"FDA has found some technical problems with the list and the data are incorrect,\" the agency said in a statement on its website. \"FDA is working to correct the list and will re-post when we are sure it is accurate.\" Tennessee has been the hardest-hit state in the meningitis outbreak, with 70 cases as of Tuesday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Michigan is a close second, with 68 cases as of Tuesday. In all, 308 cases have been tallied. CNN's Elizabeth Cohen and John Bonifield contributed to this report .",

         "Santiago, Chile (CNN) -- Sure, Luke Mescher felt a trembling fear when the walls around him started to shake Saturday, but standing around confused and scared wasn't an option. \"I was more focused on we need to get out of here and we need to get out of here as fast as we can,\" said Mescher, a University of Iowa student studying Spanish in Chile. Mescher, 27, was at the home of his host family when the 8.8-magnitude quake struck early Saturday. He was talking with friends on his computer when the power went out. Immediately after, he felt a subtle vibration that progressed into a violent shaking, he said. His host mom cried as the walls around them shook and her daughter attempted to comfort her, he said. \"They were \"paralyzed with fear,\" he said. \"I was like, we don't have time for this,\" Mescher said. \"We need to get the hell out of here.\" He grabbed his head lamp, the two women, and ran barefoot and bare-chested into the dark street. The three met dozens others in the staircase scurrying out the 20-story apartment building, he said. The exit was \"surprisingly orderly,\" Mescher said. But others faced more of an ordeal. CNN iReporter Matias de Cristobal said the earthquake destroyed many homes in her Santiago neighborhood. Cristobal tried to climb upstairs to check on her three children -- age 6, 9, and 11 -- after she began feeling tremors on Saturday, but she was slowed by shifting ground and falling objects. Mirko Vukasovic, a 25-year-old illustrator in Santiago, had been dancing at a club early Saturday when the disco ball began swinging wildly. A chaotic evacuation was under way when the lights went out, but everyone managed to escape, Vukasovic said. \"Broken windows and falling building parts was what welcomed us in the streets,\" he said. iReport: Read Mescher's firsthand account . Vukasovic submitted iReport video showing the damage to his fourth-floor apartment. \"What used to be a beautiful bathroom is now torn, a beautiful crack,\" he said as his camera panned to a pile of tile and plaster that had been shaken loose from the walls. Some in Chile reacted to the quake with disbelief. \"It was 3 or 4 in the morning and I had come home late,\" said Aneya Fernando, an American who teaches English in Santiago. \"Suddenly my bed was moving so violently that it woke me up.\" \"I'm on the 10th floor of a building and it was swaying and shaking,\" Fernando, 23, said. \"Suddenly it was just gone and I was confused. I thought it was in my head.\" When Fernando's electricity returned 30 minutes later, she learned of the earthquake on TV. Scott Ireland, a business traveler from Rochester, New York, who was staying at the Sheraton San Cristobal when the earthquake struck, submitted iReport photos of cracks in the exterior walls of his hotel. Ireland, 48, had experienced two earlier earthquakes -- one in Turkey in 1966 and another in Southern California in 1971. \"Not only was this the most severe,\" he said, \"the duration was longer than anything I'd ever experienced. Luckily the damage here was minimal.\" Meschler, the Iowa student, encountered faces of confusion and concern when he and his host family left their apartment building and entered the street. Some tried using their phones to call out with no luck, others ran to neighboring apartment complexes, looking to help. iReport: Watch video of damage at an apartment . Many throughout the city don't have their basic utilities, the Salvation Army reported. Mescher doesn't have gas, but his power and water are back on. The elderly seemed most frazzled by the rattling, he said. One elderly man had suffered a wound to his head. When the aftershocks began and kept rolling in jolts to his Santiago neighborhood, Mescher said some neighbors prepared for a night outside of their home. \"I did see a good portion of people go back upstairs an hour into it and put together what they could,\" he said, speaking of a sleep away bag. \"There were a lot of people that got their car and took off.\" Mescher had also tested his luck, considering he was unsure of the building's stability after such a great temblor. \"After we were safely outside I made a quick run and grabbed a shirt and some shoes,\" he said. About 5 a.m. (3 a.m. ET) -- about 90 minutes after the quake -- he returned to the apartment to finally get some rest, just to be rattled by another aftershock. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, a 6.9-magnitude aftershock hit Chile about that time. Dozens of aftershocks later, Mescher was looking at cracks that had shaped around the door frames and crept up walls. Chunks of plaster littered the floors, he said. \"I've got to think there have to be some long-term structural issues,\" he said. \"For the time being, I don't think it's going to fall on top of me.\"",

         "(CNN) -- What if you could change history? Would you go back and kill Hitler before the Holocaust? Arrest Oswald before JFK was assassinated? Stop Bin Laden before the 9/11 attacks? Of course you would. But what if you had to stand by and let those events unfold in order to achieve a more perfect future? That's the premise posed in \"The Revisionists,\" a new time-travel thriller from award-winning author, Thomas Mullen. In the future, there's no hunger, no war, no crime. At least, that's what we're led to believe. It's Zed's job to keep it that way. He's been sent back in time, to something similar to our present, to protect the integrity of the future timeline. To do that, Zed has to make sure that an imminent disaster of epic proportions, called \"The Great Conflagration\" happens just as history says it will, or does, or did. In his mission, Zed faces off with other time travelers, enemy agents called Hags, short for historical agitators, who want to prevent this apocalypse. Along the way, Zed crosses paths with an eclectic cast of characters, including a young Washington lawyer seeking answers about her brother, a soldier killed in Iraq; a disgraced former CIA agent; and a young Indonesian woman trapped as an indentured servant to a North Korean diplomat. Soon cracks start to appear in the timeline and Zed starts to doubt his mission. Don't let the description of the plot mislead you, this is not your typical sci-fi novel. Mullen is less concerned with the intricacies of time travel, focusing more on the nature of history and how it's shaped. As the saying goes, \"History is written by the victors\" -- but what if there were no winners in this scenario? In \"The Revisionists,\" Mullen presents a compelling and complex page-turner, a paranoid thriller for the post-9/11 age. CNN recently sat down with Mullen to talk about his new book; the following is an edited transcript: . CNN: What was the spark that led to this book? Mullen: There were a lot of sparks. It's a book that involves different narratives. I'd had the idea of this guy who comes back from the future and has to prevent bad things from happening. He's justifying his bad means because there's going to be a perfect end. I just thought that was an intriguing moral angle. I thought it was fun and I thought it had interesting interplay with the idea of intelligence agencies occasionally doing bad things but saying, oh it's for a good cause. I'd heard a story about this issue of domestic servants basically being kept as slaves in these really nice houses in D.C. because their bosses are diplomats who can hide behind diplomatic immunity, and I thought that was a really interesting idea but I wasn't sure what I was going to do with it. I was also interested in the idea of intelligence agents, either governmental or private, following peace activists, because that was happening. It's not legal, it's not supposed to happen, but you hear stories about police officers, mysterious agents, agent provocateurs with a group of peace activists, trying to get them all amped up so they would do something wrong so they could get arrested. You'd like to think these things don't happen, but you keep hearing about things like that happening. I thought that would be an intriguing story. So, I was kind of juggling these different ideas, then I put it aside, but I still, every now and then, would work on it. There were a lot of false starts with this. It took me a while to get some of these threads together in a way that I liked them. There were these different stories that I liked that I wanted to figure out and I asked myself, is this one book? Do these things go together; do I need to cut some of them out? I did end up cutting out some of the activist stuff, but I wanted to find a way to thread these different narratives together and see if it could all come together. It may have been a little messy but I hope in the end it worked. CNN: You really play with the idea of \"history\" in your book. Mullen: As somebody who has previously written two historical novels, in a lot of ways this book is a departure for me. At the same time this book is sort of about history, how it's formed and how we are products of our own history. The question comes up in the book; do we control our own fate? Can we make our own history or are we just pawns? That taps into this conspiracist view of the world that created a lot of great fiction and film in the 1970 like \"All the President's Men\" and \"The Conversation.\" There's this sense that there's this vast conspiracy of forces controlling us, that the government is listening to everything we do and there's nothing we can do about it. It's easy to think that way, especially now, but at the same time we also believe we're a country where a skinny interracial kid ... can become president. You never really know what's going to happen; you never know what's going to be historically important. There's the butterfly effect where one little thing here could change the world for someone else. So I was thinking about that a lot and the struggle that we all feel; how much control do I have over my fate, the country, my community? Do I really believe in a perfect future? Some of us would like to think we're creating a better future, especially if we're in politics or public service. We're trying to take a bad situation and make it better. But how much better can we make it? Are we just pushing a rock up a hill and it's going to come down and crush us again? Do we really believe in a perfect society and the idea that America is a noble experiment and we're still working on it to try and get it right? Can anything really be perfect and does that road lead to these totalitarian regimes? The desire to create a better world is a noble goal and we all have it but it can be taken in scary directions. When you have these totalitarian nations, these communist nations that say they're creating a perfect society when really most of us would say they've done the opposite. Trying to control history, or the lack of control, that's something the book deals with. CNN: How did you handle the idea of time travel in your novel? Mullen: I didn't want to write a book with some guy zipping in and out of various situations; I wanted it to be set in the here and now. I liked the idea of a time traveler not just for the moral dilemma but I think he has a great perspective on how he sees our world now, all the tensions in our society, the issues of race and ethnicity. To him he's coming from many, many generations later. I was influenced by this Time magazine cover story, the face of the future and there was this computer program that melded thousands of faces, many generations later after all the races have mixed, this is what people will look like. If I want to be realistic about the idea of a time traveler coming from the future, he's not going to look like us, he's not going to be a white guy, he's not going to be a black guy, he's going to be kind of this amalgam. In any book, it's not a new idea in a time travel story to have everybody say, wait a minute are you just pulling one over on us, are you crazy, are you a reliable narrator? That was fun to work in. CNN: \"The Revisionists\" includes a lot of great detail about U.S. intelligence agencies. Tell me how you researched all of this? Mullen: As with a lot of fiction, some of it was smoke and mirrors and the rest of it was basically just doing a lot of reading. I wasn't a spy and I don't have any friends who were spies, as far as I know. The book changed a lot; I went in different directions because the more I learned I would find a more believable way to advance the story. I think the initial idea I had wouldn't have worked as well and I don't think it would have made you think, \"Wow, this guy knows what he's talking about.\" I learned as I went and I was able to tell a more realistic story as a result. But I didn't go on any drive-bys with any spies, although that would have been cool. CNN: What's next for you? Mullen: I've actually written a lot of my next book already, it's historical again. I'm from Boston, Rhode Island actually, but I'm a Red Sox fan. It's loosely based on a real story, that I found out about in an offhand mention, about FBI involvement in Boston sports, it's a legacy that dates back to 1945 when the FBI was following a group of communists who wanted to racially integrate baseball. I thought, Wow! What's that story? So it's sort of a spy novel, it's also got a bit of romance, and even comedy. I've got an FBI agent, I've also got a female communist sports writer and I've got a baseball star of the Negro League back from World War II. I said I wasn't going to keep writing in a historical vein but sometimes I see an idea and I think that's just too cool. It's been fun to write.

         "(CNN) -- Five police officers brutally kicked and beat an unconscious suspect after a high-speed chase through Birmingham, Alabama, in an incident caught on camera and discovered a year later. Video shows one black and four white officers beating and kicking unconscious man ejected from car. The five officers have been fired, Mayor Larry Langford said at a news conference Wednesday. An internal inquiry is continuing. The dashboard-cam footage, which officials believe was shot in January 2008, was aired for reporters Wednesday. It showed the end of a 100-mile-an-hour police chase of a van driven by Anthony Warren, suspected of illegal drug activity. Police had chased the van almost 50 miles, winding from downtown Birmingham to suburban Hoover. The video captured the van knocking down a police officer standing on a roadway, then turning up an interstate highway ramp, where it flipped over and rolled into a ditch. Warren was ejected from the van and stopped moving. The five officers -- one black, four white -- ruthlessly beat the suspect, who is black, the video shows.  Watch the tape that lead to the officers' dismissal » . A police mug shot taken five days after the beating was posted on the Web site of The Birmingham News. It shows a badly bruised man wearing a neck brace. Police Chief A.C. Roper told CNN that the video was brought to his attention in March by the district attorney's office, which stumbled upon the footage as it was preparing for Warren's trial. Warren was charged with attempted murder, but no trial took place because he pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of aggravated assault. He is in prison serving a 20-year sentence. Roper said he was \"shocked\" to learn of the video and that it had been around for so long without his knowledge. In addition to a continuing internal investigation that could lead to disciplining supervisors, he said the Alabama Bureau of Investigation is considering criminal charges against the five officers. Langford said the incident brought back to mind days of segregation and police brutality toward blacks. \"The culture of the past was that police brutality was acceptable,\" Langford said. \"In Birmingham, Alabama, in the present day, it is not acceptable.\" Langford said the five officers showed exceptional restraint in chasing the fleeing suspect and performed in exemplary fashion until the last scene caught on the video. The camera captured 11 seconds of the five officers beating Warren with their fists and batons. \"Those 11 seconds will not be tolerated,\" said Langford, who signed letters of termination for the five officers on Tuesday. \"Over 50 years of combined police experience gone over 11 seconds,\" he said.",

         "Atlanta (CNN) -- Call it a crisis of faith. A co-worker and I walked into the office break room Wednesday, national Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day, to find a dozen or so foil-wrapped sandwiches beckoning us from the counter. This being Atlanta, home of Chick-fil-A, we recognized them immediately, and a closer look at the puck-sized packages bearing the iconic scribbled red logo confirmed our suspicions -- and deepened our paranoia. \"Is this a trick?\" my co-worker asked as he stood frozen in front of the counter. \"Will someone judge me if they see me eating one?\" We had no idea where they had come from and still don't, but our break room is often the dumping ground of leftovers from business meetings where food is served. I also froze in silence because I knew that the answer was yes, some would judge him, at least for the time being, while the company's stance on same-sex marriage is in the spotlight, sparking impassioned op-eds and fiery debate on cable news networks and Facebook Walls across the country. Supporters on both sides of the debate have staged demonstrations, starting with Wednesday's appreciation day and Friday's same-sex \"kiss day\" at Chick-fil-A restaurants across the country. Are you going to \"kiss day\" at Chick-fil-A? Share your story with CNN iReport . Ever since Truett Cathy opened the first Chick-fil-A Restaurant at a mall in suburban Atlanta in 1967, the company has made no secret of its dedication to Christian values. Its corporate purpose is to \"glorify God by being a faithful steward of all that is entrusted to us\" and \"to have a positive influence on all who come in contact with Chick-fil-A.\" All of its locations are closed on Sunday. Chick-fil-A controversy shines light on company's charitable giving . Within this context, many Americans -- including residents of Atlanta, the ninth \"gayest\" American city in 2012, according The Advocate magazine -- have chosen either to enjoy Chick-fil-A's sandwich variations or to not patronize the restaurant because of its values. Or, you might be like one of my gay friends, who would ask others to stand in line for his Chick-fil-A lunch, lest his boyfriend find out. But for many, COO Dan Cathy's recent comment that he supports the \"biblical definition of the family unit\" has forced their hands, compelling them to publicly choose a side and politicize their eating habits. Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day was proposed by former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee in an effort to show support for the company's viewpoint. Those who chose to support Chick-fil-A on Wednesday led to record-breaking sales, the company said, though it did not provide specific sales numbers. \"Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day was not a company promotion; it was initiated by others,\" said Steve Robinson, executive vice president for marketing, in a statement Thursday. \"The Chick-fil-A culture and service tradition in our restaurants is to treat every person with honor, dignity and respect, regardless of their belief, race, creed, sexual orientation or gender.\" Time will tell whether Chick-fil-A suffers any actual fallout from the controversy or if it's just another \"media-driven controversy,\" as some have suggested. After all, Ben & Jerry's is still going strong despite coming out in support of same-sex marriage with flavors like Apple-y Ever After and Chubby Hubby. Californians still swear by In-N-Out Burger regardless of whether their burger comes with a large drink and a citation from a Bible passage. In the meantime, both sides have fanned the flames with high-profile demonstrations and heated rhetoric. Others are left somewhere in the middle, still craving an original chicken sandwich but reluctant to subject themselves to the scrutiny of friends and colleagues, like my co-worker. Heather Roberts of Sugar Land, Texas, made a point of patronizing at Chick-fil-A on Wednesday while visiting Atlanta for a conference. \"We wanted to eat here today, especially to show support not just for Christian values but for his right to express his beliefs,\" Roberts said shortly after finishing a chicken sandwich and waffle fries from a Chick-fil-A stand in the CNN Center food court. She said she shared Cathy's position on same-sex marriage, acknowledging that if the controversy centered around his support for it, she wouldn't have participated in appreciation day. Normally, though, she eats at her local Chick-fil-A at least once a week because she appreciates the food and the customer service -- not because of its Christian values. \"I'm allowed to eat where I want,\" she said. \"We need to be appreciative that we live in a country where we can say what we want and eat where we want.\" Even some people who oppose Cathy's views didn't feel the need to boycott the restaurant, especially if those views don't lead to discrimination against customers or employees. \"I don't agree with the owners' beliefs, but they publicly state that they will serve all who enter the door,\" CNN commenter Doug Barger said. \"I believe in religious freedom,\" the Greenwood, Ohio, resident wrote in an e-mail. \"Because the owner's personal opinions differ from mine points to a healthy society.\" For many, Cathy's views are secondary to his right express them, even among members of the LGBT community. \"Mr. Cathy has been unfairly attacked for his statement that he doesn't support same-sex marriage,\" said Matt Zieminski, a 20-year-old iReporter from California. \"As a gay man, I say, let him not support gays. When the gay community and gay activist groups push on anti-gay people and organizations to change their minds and opinions via bullying or forced involvement, I fear it would make whatever accomplishments taste cheap like a greasy coin. Ultimately, the acceptance of the gay community and the right of gays to marry will not be achieved through violent means, physical and verbal, but through peaceful and honest negotiations.\" How the Chick-fil-A same-sex marriage controversy has evolved . Predictably, Cathy's stance on same-sex marriage kept others away Wednesday. \"I think the (COO) has made eating at Chick-fil-A a political statement. I wouldn't (have) had a problem eating there before, but now that the restaurant has turned into a campaign to bash the rights of the LGBT community, I realize I can put my money somewhere else,\" CNN commenter Wade Pierson said. \"As a born-again gay Christian, it saddens me to see Christians feeding into politics. Politics just divides people and stirs up a lot of anger.\" As counterprotests in the form of \"kiss-ins\" take shape Friday, some would just as soon stay away from Chick-fil-A this week to avoid making the act of eating chicken political. \"Both sides have very good points, but both sides are also wrong, and they're both making this into something far bigger than it needs to be,\" said an Atlanta-based CNN commenter who preferred not to be named. \"Both sides just quite honestly need to grow up and stop acting like 2-year-olds just because somebody said something they didn't like.\" The Atlanta resident says she does not plan to boycott the chain altogether because she agrees with both sides. And she likes the food. Plus, if you start boycotting Chick-fil-A because you disagree with the COO's views, how far will you take your principles? \"I'm very impressed with people that try to avoid right-wing companies from profiting off of them. Trying to avoid Koch products would be really hard. I mean, they even make asphalt!\" a friend said in response to my Facebook question, \"are you conflicted over buying Chick-fil-A?\" \"It's not a political issue for me. I think it's more of a way for people to define themselves in front of their friends,\" she said. \"It reminds me a lot of KONY, people getting riled up over something as a way to define themselves.\" As for my co-worker, he quickly gobbled down his sandwich in the break room while we speculated over where they might have come from. He finished it before others entered the room, tsking as they pulled out their smartphones to take pictures. Two hours later, the rest of the sandwiches were gone.

         "(CNN) -- A diamond unearthed in the southern African nation of Lesotho could yield one of the largest and highest quality round polished diamonds, according to a statement Monday from company that found it. A mining company unearthed this 478-carat diamond in the southern African nation of Lesotho. Experts in Antwerp, Belgium who analyzed the 478-carat stone determined it to be of the highest color grading available for a white diamond, said a statement from Gem Diamonds Ltd., the company that found the stone. \"What makes it more remarkable is the color and quality of this stone,\" said diamond consultant Neil Buxton. \"It's a D color, which is the highest possible graded color you can get, and we believe there is a chance -- a very good chance -- of getting a 100-carat plus\" round stone with the highest color and clarity rankings. The company said such a stone would \"to the best of our knowledge\" be \"the first one in history.\"  Watch more on the diamond » . The diamond, which was found in September, ranks as the 20th largest rough diamond ever found, but is not the biggest ever taken from the Letseng Mine, which is co-owned by Gem Diamonds Ltd. and the Kingdom of Lesotho, a country of 2.1 million that is surrounded by South Africa. Two bigger stones -- 603 and 493 carats -- were found in the mine in 2006 and 2007, respectively, the company said. A 601-carat diamond was mined there in 1960, it said.",

         "(CNN) -- Luis Suarez committed his \"long term\" future to Liverpool Friday by signing a new four-and-a-half year deal with the English Premier League giants. The 26-year-old Uruguayan international has bagged a league-leading 17 goals in 11 EPL starts this season to lead Liverpool's title challenge. Suarez was the subject of two bids in the last transfer window from Arsenal, who currently top the standings, two points clear of second-placed Liverpool. But after his superb start to the current campaign he has chosen to extend his current contract, which was due to expire in 2016. \"I am delighted to have agreed a new deal with Liverpool and have my future secured for the long term,\" Suarez told Liverpool's official website. \"We have some great players and the team is growing and improving all the time. I believe I can achieve the ambitions of winning trophies and playing at the very highest level with Liverpool. My aim is to help get us there as quickly as possible,\" he added. Manager Brendan Rodgers was naturally delighted to persuade Suarez to sign on the dotted line, with the striker integral to his plans for the club. \"Luis is a world-class talent and securing his services is crucial for what we are trying to achieve here,\" he said. \"What's most important and most exciting is that, at just 26 years old, his best years are still ahead of him and we now know we'll be seeing him reach that potential in a Liverpool shirt.\" Suarez was signed by then Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish from Ajax Amsterdam in January 2011 and immediately impressed observers. But his time on Merseyside has also been marked by two highly controversial incidents, resulting in lengthy bans. He was found guilty by the English Football Association (FA) of racially abusing Manchester United defender Patrice Evra at a match in October 2011 and given an eight-game suspension. At the end of last season, Suarez appeared to bite Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic in an EPL game at Anfield and was banned for 10 games by the FA for violent conduct. With Suarez set to miss out on the start of the new EPL campaign and reportedly wanting to leave Liverpool, Arsenal tabled a record bid of Â£40 million ($65.38 million) plus Â£1 bid, designed to invoke the exit clause in his contract. It was rejected by Liverpool, who proceeded to make a strong start to the season, boosted by the eventual return of Suarez in late September after his ban. He has acquired hero status with the Liverpool fans -- desperate for success after seeing arch-rivals Manchester United take over as the most successful club in English football. Suarez said their support had \"influenced his decision.\" Suarez, who is expected to star for Uruguay in next year's World Cup where they will meet England in the group stages, added: \"We have a special relationship; they have love for me and in return I love them back.\"",

         "(CNN) -- A drunk passenger tried to hijack a Turkish Airlines flight to Russia on Wednesday before he was brought under control, the head of Turkey's civil aviation authority said. The Turkish Airlines passenger jet was en route from Turkey to Russia when the incident took place. The plane landed safely and on time Wednesday afternoon in St. Petersburg. Russian authorities promptly arrested a \"slightly intoxicated\" passenger from Uzbekistan, Russia's Interfax News Agency reported, citing a national police spokesman. The suspect, in his early 50s, was arrested on suspicion of trying to hijack the plane, Interfax reported. Turkish media initially reported that the plane had been hijacked. When asked about those reports, a Turkish Airlines spokesman said the flight experienced an \"urgent situation\" as it headed to St. Petersburg, without offering further details. Interfax said the flight was carrying 164 Russian nationals. There have been several attempts to hijack Turkish airlines in recent years. In August 2007, two men hijacked an Istanbul-bound Atlasjet Airlines flight with 136 passengers and crew on board from Cyprus, claiming to have a bomb on board the flight. They forced the crew to make an emergency landing in Antalya. Both hijackers eventually surrendered to Turkish authorities. In April 2007, Turkish authorities detained a man they believed tried to hijack a Turkish airliner, possibly to Iran. The suspect, Mehmed Goksin Gol, was not armed and all 178 passengers and crew aboard the Pegasus Airlines flight were unharmed. The flight was heading from southeastern Turkish city of Diyarbakir to Istanbul, but landed at Ankara's airport, where the suspect was detained. In October 2006, a Turkish man hijacked a Turkish jetliner with 113 people aboard en route from the Albanian capital Tirana for Istanbul. He forced it to fly to a military airfield in Brindisi, Italy, where the passengers and crew were released unharmed.

         "Jerusalem (CNN) -- Two Iranian warships are expected to pass through the Suez Canal Wednesday night on their way to Syria, a move that Israel considers a \"provocation\" and that sent oil prices soaring. The passage, which Iran said was part of a training mission, is \"something which has not happened in many years,\" Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman said. \"This is a provocation that proves that the self-confidence and insolence of the Iranians is growing from day to day,\" he said. \"This happens after the Iranian president's visit to south Lebanon and his aggressive declarations there towards Israel.\" The Israeli Defense Ministry said Israel was monitoring the movement of the Iranian ships and alerted its allies. Crude oil for delivery in March rose as much as 1.2% to $85.95 a barrel, following the news. Brent crude, which is traded primarily overseas in Europe, rose as much as 2.1% to $103.31 a barrel. Traders urged caution, saying the reports were still vague. \"The reports are sketchy at the moment, but the news of Iranian warships in the Suez did rally the market a bit,\" said Andrew Lebow, a commodities broker with MF Global. \"The market is looking for more information but certainly we're seeing some short covering on the reports.\" The Suez Canal serves as a key passageway for international trade, allowing ships to navigate between Europe and Asia without having to go all the way around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. Millions of barrels of oil move through the Suez every day on the way to both Europe and North America. Iranian Navy officials have said the flotilla has embarked on a yearlong training mission that takes it to the Gulf of Aden to the Red Sea and through the Suez Canal into the Mediterranean Sea, according to the semi-official Fars News Agency. During the mission, Iranian Navy cadets are due to be trained and prepared for defending the country's cargo ships and oil tankers. Iranian Navy Cmdr. Rear Adm. Habibollah Sayyari said cadets would be trained to protect ships and tankers now under threat of attack from Somali pirates, Fars said. Part of the mission was also to gather intelligence. Sayyari said the ships were in the region in \"pursuit of a powerful (military) presence in the high seas and to consolidate our friendly ties and declare our message of peace and friendship to the regional countries.\" Liberman urged Israel's allies to pay attention. \"We expect the international community to act speedily with determination against the Iranian provocations, designed to deteriorate the situation in the area, and put the Iranians in their place,\" he said. Liberman's comments were not so much a threat but a wake-up call about a \"worrying development,\" said a senior government official who was not identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media. The official said Liberman was \"painting it as a challenge to the West.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamim Netanyahu's office offered no immediate comment. CNN's Kevin Flower and journalist Ken Sweet contributed to this report .",

         "(CNN) -- Chelsea have completed the English Premier League and FA Cup double for the first time in their history after a hard-fought 1-0 cup final win over Portsmouth at Wembley Stadium on Saturday. In a topsy-turvy match, which saw two penalties missed in a frantic second-half, Didier Drogba's superb long-range free-kick eventually proved the difference, as both sides wasted a host of chances to find the net. In a strange twist of fate, the final was played between the last two winners of the competition -- Portsmouth (2008) and Chelsea (2009) -- but the similarity between the two sides ended there. Chelsea had sealed the Premier League title with an 8-0 thrashing of Wigan last weekend, while Portsmouth had suffered a dreadful season in which they became the first Premier League club to enter administration after accumulating huge debts -- subsequently finishing bottom of the table and suffering relegation to the second tier Championship. And that gulf in class between the sides showed in the opening 45 minutes, with Chelsea remarkably hitting the woodwork five times as they peppered the Portsmouth goal. The most glaring miss came from Ivory Coast striker Salomon Kalou, who somehow contrived to hit the crossbar with an open goal gaping, after being superbly set-up by left-back Ashley Cole. Frank Lampard's dipping long-range strike and John Terry's looping header also struck the woodwork, while Drogba gave notice of what was to come in the second half with a stunning free-kick, which England goalkeeper David James somehow managed to get a fingertip to, with the ball bouncing onto the goalline and away. Portsmouth themselves had a great opportunity in the first half, when Frederic Piquionne diverted a cross goalbound, only for goalkeeper Petr Cech to instinctively scramble the ball clear. Underdogs Portsmouth began the second half with more purpose and should have taken a surprise lead. Aruna Dindane out-paced substitute Julian Belletti, who had come on for the injured Michael Ballack, and was fouled by the Brazilian in the penalty area. However, Kevin-Prince Boateng's weak spot-kick was hit straight down the middle, allowing Cech to save with his legs. And Portsmouth were made to play for that miss just two minutes later when Drogba found a gap in the Portsmouth wall to fire his free-kick into the far corner of James' net. Chelsea squandered further chances to double their lead, most notably when Frank Lampard missed the game's second penalty four minutes from the end after Lampard himself had been fouled by Michael Brown. However, Portsmouth failed to trouble Cech's goal after that, although substitute Nadir Belhadj produced a couple of dangerous crosses from the left that caused panic in the Chelsea defence. After the game, Chelsea captain John Terry paid tribute to his side, who join Tottenham (1961), Liverpool (1986), Arsenal (1971, 1998, 2002) and Manchester United (1994, 1996 and 1999) as modern-day \"Double\" winners. \"This is an unbelievable feeling and to win the Double with this group of players is just fantastic,\" Terry told ITV Sport. \"I thought our luck was running out with all those misses but it was a great strike from Didier and I thought we were worthy winners. \"The pitch was awful, the worse pitch we have played on this season, but we played our football and managed to get the victory.\" The result was also a personal triumph for manager Carlo Ancelotti, who managed to achieve what no other Chelsea manager -- including Jose Mourinho -- had achieved by winning the \"Double\" in his first season in charge at Stamford Bridge.",

Having captivated moviegoers both in front of and behind the camera with \"Argo,\" Ben Affleck earned the number one spot on our annual list of the most talented and original performers who entertained us in 2012. Fifteen years after he bounded onto the Hollywood scene in 1997′s \"Good Will Hunting,\" the 40-year-old Affleck is now older and wiser — and may very well be headed back to the Oscar stage for his political thriller about the real-life covert CIA mission that freed six diplomats from Tehran during the Iran hostage crisis. \"I had very low expectations for 'Argo's' performance,\" says the leading man-turned-director. \"I just hoped that over time people would find the movie. Also, being at a place in my life and my career where I know what I'm trying to do, it's different than being 26. When you're younger and have the early success that I had — it sounds like the worst Hallmark cliche — but I didn't have anyone to share it with. I don't mean I wanted someone to sit by the fire with. But when you have a family and children, you kind of see yourself reflected in them. I want to make the kinds of movies that my kids are proud of. I have higher standards, in a way, for them.\" Not that everyone back at the Affleck household was thrilled about his shaggy '70s Method hairdo and beard. Says Affleck of his wife Jennifer Garner's reaction: \"My wife is a very polite and kind woman. She and the kids did not like the beard. It had an exposed wire vibe. It was hated in my home.\" EW Daily Poll: 'New Girl': Who'd make the best match? \"Argo\" producer George Clooney also weighs in on Affleck's triumphant return to the A-list after a decade of ups and downs. \"Hollywood loves a comeback, and he's an unbelievable comeback kid.\" Of course, Affleck isn't the only person who had a great year. That's why we asked a select group of famous folks to offer their own tributes to the others who made our list: .

         "(CNN) -- British Prime Minister David Cameron has given Sri Lanka a March 2014 deadline to hold an independent international inquiry into alleged war crimes during the country's 26-year civil war. Cameron held talks with Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa while in the capital of Colombo for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting on Friday. The summit opened Friday amid concerns about the rights situation after Sri Lanka's war with the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, which ended in 2009. The prime ministers of Canada, Mauritius and India opted not to attend. On Saturday, Cameron acknowledged that Sri Lanka had suffered \"almost three decades of bloody conflict\" and that recovery and reconciliation took time. He said he made it clear to Rajapaksa that he had \"a real opportunity, through magnanimity and reform, to build a successful, inclusive and prosperous future for his country.\" Among the steps needed to achieve this were \"credible, transparent and independent investigations into alleged war crimes,\" Cameron said. \"And let me be very clear. If that investigation is not completed by March, then I will use our position on the U.N. Human Rights Council to work with the U.N. Human Rights Commissioner and call for a full, credible and independent international inquiry.\" Cameron said his meeting with the president was \"very frank\" and \"nothing was off the agenda.\" Read more: Cameron mobbed by protesters in Sri Lanka . A statement issued by Rajapaksa's office earlier Saturday, noted that Cameron had raised concerns \"relating to displaced persons, land issues, military presence in the Province and devolving powers to the newly elected Council.\" \"President Rajapaksa, in response, explained that an enormous amount of work has been done in terms of resettlement, rehabilitation and reconstruction of infrastructure destroyed during the conflict. In order to reach consensus on political matters a Parliamentary Special Committee (PSC) has been established for all parties concerned to air their views and reach a settlement,\" it said. Read more: Sri Lankan diplomat says rights criticism 'proxy propaganda war' The statement said Rajapaksa had observed that the PSC was the best forum for the purpose, stating: \"As it is now only four years since the end of the conflict the country needs some more time to overcome all major challenges.\" In an interview that aired Thursday on CNN's \"Amanpour,\" Sri Lanka's high commissioner to the United Kingdom, Chris Nonis, also denied that an independent international inquiry was needed. \"We respect the independence and sovereignty of your country, and we expect you to respect ours. We don't need an international investigation when we have had a vibrant civilization for 2,500 years. We have perfectly educated people, and I think we're perfectly capable of carrying out our own domestic inquiry,\" he told CNN's Frederik Pleitgen. Nonis pointed to the 2011 \"Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission\" report, which Rajapaksa ordered. \"It's a very holistic, very comprehensive, very impartial report. It had over 5,000 hearings, and it's set within the principle of international humanitarian law, incorporating the principle of distinction and the principle of proportionality.\" Independent judiciary? As many as 70,000 people were killed in Sri Lanka's war. In its final stage, which lasted from September 2008 to May 2009, the Sri Lankan army advanced into an area of the north where about 330,000 people were trapped by fighting. A U.N. report in 2011 said the government used \"large-scale and widespread shelling\" that left a large number of civilians dead. The number of civilian deaths and injuries are unknown to this day, and U.N. figures greatly differ from those in reports from Sri Lanka's government and various nongovernmental organizations. The International Bar Association's Human Rights Institute on Friday questioned whether Sri Lanka's legal system was capable of responding to human rights violations, saying that required an independent judiciary. \"Since the end of the armed conflict, the Sri Lankan government has been systematically dismantling checks and balances on independent justice institutions,\" co-chair Helena Kennedy said in a statement. \"The IBAHRI considers that the lack of an independent judiciary will prevent the Sri Lankan legal system from providing an effective investigation into war crimes and human rights violations committed by government forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam at the end of the armed conflict in 2009.\" The Commonwealth is a voluntary association of 53 nations that initially formed out of what had been the British Empire. Its charter focuses on developing \"free and democratic societies and the promotion of peace and prosperity to improve the lives of all peoples of the Commonwealth.\" Heads of member governments meet every two years.",

         "SEATTLE, Washington (CNN) -- An accident involving de-icing solution being sprayed on an Alaska Airlines plane in snow-covered Seattle sent seven people to a hospital Wednesday, airport and hospital officials said. Emergency vehicles gather around Alaska Airlines planes in Seattle, Washington, on Wednesday. The seven, who were crew members, were transported to Highline Medical Center for minor issues, such as eye irritation, dizziness and nausea, said Sea-Tac Airport spokesman Perry Cooper. Eighteen passengers were treated at the scene. There had been an initial report that two people were badly hurt, but Cooper said all of the injuries were minor. He said six of the crew members transported to the hospital were working and one was off duty. Caroline Boren, Alaska Airlines spokeswoman, confirmed the injury numbers and said the most extensive treatment given to the passengers was an eye wash. None of them requested further treatment or were transported to the hospital. Matt Crockett, assistant administrator at Highline Medical Center, confirmed the hospital was assessing seven people in its emergency room. He said six of them were in satisfactory condition and another was still being evaluated. The incident began when fumes from the de-icing application got into the cabin of Alaska Airlines Flight 528.  Watch an ex-transportation official explain how the fumes seeped into the plane » . Alaska Airlines said the flight was getting ready for takeoff to Burbank, California, when passengers began to complain of eye irritation and strong fumes from the chemicals. Video footage showed several emergency vehicles around the plane on the snow-covered tarmac. The airline said the plane, a Boeing 737-800, was carrying 143 passengers and several crew members. Boren called the situation \"very unusual\" and said maintenance crew had been working on the plane. Cooper said the airline was bringing in another aircraft to transport the passengers to their destination. Seattle has been blanketed with nearly 9 inches of snow this week, and forecasters predicted snow mixed with rain Wednesday, with an accumulation of about a half inch of new snow through Thursday. One passenger, Joe Dial of Seattle, told CNN affiliate KIRO-TV that passengers were exposed to the de-icer fumes for 45 minutes before they were able to leave the plane. The jetliner had pulled away from the gate Wednesday morning, but then had to return for the de-icing process, Dial told KIRO. Meanwhile in Moline, Illinois, an AirTran Airways jet skidded off the runway at Quad City International Airport, CNN affiliate WQAD-TV reported. Witnesses said passengers were being evacuated to buses, and there appeared to be no injuries, according to WQAD. The airport was closed to all traffic after the accident, the station said. At airports elsewhere across the U.S., weather was forcing significant delays as travelers tried to reach their destinations by Christmas. Flights bound for Newark-Liberty International Airport in New Jersey faced delays averaging three hours. Flights into Chicago's O'Hare International Airport in Illinois, John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and San Francisco International Airport in California were all subject to delays averaging an hour or more, according to the FAA. Travelers at O'Hare were hoping Wednesday went better than the day before as thousands were stranded in the nation's second-busiest airport overnight when hundreds of flights were canceled. \"It is ruining my holiday,\" one stranded passenger, Keith Bouchard, told CNN affiliate WLS-TV. \"I am not going to have a holiday mood till I get home,\" stranded passenger Ken Estes told WLS. O'Hare's trouble extended to South Florida, where Laura Weichhand and Rachel Lewis got stuck at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport when their flight to Chicago was canceled. \"If we want to be home for Christmas ... our only option is we're going to drive 26 hours to be home for Christmas,\" Lewis told CNN affiliate WPLG-TV. The Chicago area was expected to get 1 inch to 3 inches of new snow Wednesday. At Colorado's Denver International Airport, lost luggage was a huge problem. Thousands of pieces of unclaimed baggage were in the airport's arrivals area, CNN affiliate KMGH-TV reported. Deanna Nokes, who was stranded in Denver on her way to Portland, Oregon, told KGMH her bags were nowhere in sight. \"They don't even know where my bag is,\" she told the station. \"It still could be in Vegas, or Phoenix, or Portland.\" Airports in Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington, were hit hardest by weather delays earlier in the week, with hundreds of flight cancellations Sunday through Tuesday. The two Northwest airports were reporting just a few delays Wednesday, but a new storm was rolling in from the Pacific Ocean, bringing snow and rain, the National Weather Service said. \"It will not be as strong as this past weekend's storm,\" said weather service meteorologist Kirby Cook in Seattle. But that may be of little consolation to thousands of travelers stranded at Northwest airports because of cancellations earlier in the week. Alaska Airlines, the area's major carrier, said fully booked holiday flights left it with few options to accommodate the weather weary, CNN affiliate KHQ-TV in Spokane, Washington, reported. Some in Spokane turned to Craigslist.com to try to get home for Christmas. The Web site had more than 30 posts from people looking to get to or out of Spokane, CNN affiliate KXLY-TV reported. \"I know Craigslist has a rideshare community so I thought I'd try, and so far not so good,\" Priscilla Davis of Federal Way, Washington, told KXLY.",

         "(CNN) -- Antwan \"Big Boi\" Patton considers himself a \"truther.\" The 37-year-old rapper, producer and one-half of the legendary hip hop group OutKast said his grandmother once told him his position as a public figure was to bring valuable information to his audience and community. \"There's facts right there in your face,\" Big Boi said. \"They've got a cure for cancer, they've got a cure for AIDS, cure for everything, but they make so much money off the medicine you'll never see it. The people have to understand that.\" CNN Soundwaves: Big Boi on Big Boi . Talking about life . According to Big Boi the average person is living an illusion and accepting false information. Hence the name of his latest solo album (he counts it as his third, calling \"Speakerboxxx\" his actual first album), \"Vicious Lies and Dangerous Rumors,\" which he has called an overall \"search for truth.\" Released via Def Jam, \"VLADR\" is a follow-up to Big Boi's 2010 release, \"Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty,\" and comes from a title his grandmother had for her (planned?) autobiography in which she would air the family's dirty laundry. Big Boi's latest musical effort is his way of exposing himself and the world around him. \"I'm talking about life,\" he said of the 14-track disc (17 if you nabbed the deluxe version). \"Some people don't get that because they're so numb to what the mainstream media is pumping into their head with these reality shows and a certain type of song that's played 1,000 times on the radio every day and I refuse to do that.\" So what did he do? If you were to ask the music critics, Big Boi just released his most complete work to date and the closest fans will get (for now) to an OutKast album in terms of it's boldness in sound and creative risks. But before Big Boi could ever move forward carving out his legacy, he had to shake an old stigma from his past. 'The player and the poet' Shortly after the success of their first hit single, \"Player's Ball\" in 1993, Big Boi and his partner-in-rhyme Andre 3000 were dubbed \"the player and the poet,\" with Patton playing the role of the former. Through marketing and promotion, Big Boi was cast as the bad boy, while Andre was the thoughtful, creative one. Big Boi maintains that he has never liked the moniker. \"Everybody thought I was just a DBoy. I'm just selling dope and getting laid all day,\" he said. \"I think when they put that title on it people kind of took it and ran with it.\" OutKast went on to sell more than 20 million records, earning multiple Grammys, including album of the year in 2004, and the group has since been hailed as creative geniuses and one of the greatest hip-hop groups of all time. Search for truth . While \"VLADR\" has a lot of George Clinton-style funk and features indie rockers Phantogram and Little Dragon, it also carries the political punch of Public Enemy, with songs like \"Shoes for Running,\" which some might say borders on conspiracy theory. One of the track's opening lines is: \"I wish they could send me to the moon and back with a cure for cancer and save the lives of my great grandmomma and great granddaddy now that's the answer to the question/ but they make money off the medicine leaving us all stuck in elections with no progressions just recessions.\" And so back to that whole \"truther\" thing, which Big Boi said is just his taking the time to find information and share it with anyone who will listen. He is also quick to strike down the conspiracy theorist label. \"I mean its drone strikes, United States killing kids overseas every day, they're not telling you about that,\" he said. \"Why not? Are our kids' lives more valuable than the ones' overseas? A child is a child. These are facts. There's no conspiracy in this.\" Best friends . Another theory Big Boi finds himself dealing with is the status of OutKast and his relationship with Andre 3000. There was the whole Gillette \"diss\" and the apology Andre 3000 made to Big Boi via T.I.'s \"I'm Sorry.\" Or could it just be the fact that since, really, 2000's \"Stankonia,\" the duo has more or less not made an album together? If you listen carefully, Big Boi addresses the matter on \"VLADR,\" but he doesn't hold back if asked about it, either. \"People don't know or they don't catch all of the interviews and then (there's) all the sensational headlines, but you've got to really understand that me and Dre have a relationship that's bigger than music,\" he said. \"We're best friends. Music just came along because it's what we're put here to do and what God brought us together to do. But that's my brother; you know what I'm saying? There's no beef, no nothing.\" In fact, not one song made it to the final cut of \"VLADR\" without a listen from Andre 3000, Big Boi said. Verbal exercises . Fans and the Internet were abuzz when word got out Big Boi and Dre would be \"reuniting\" for Frank Ocean's \"Pink Matter,\" and T.I.'s I'm Sorry,\" both tracks that already featured Andre 3000. In a text message, Big Boi responded to the idea of these songs being OutKast reunions. \"They aren't,\" he wrote. \"I'm just verbally exercising.\" To the folks calling for a new OutKast album, Big's answer is, well, honest. \"If we did records like what I'm doing right now, if I go so deep y'all will never get an OutKast album,\" he said. \"We ain't excited about doing an OutKast album because people ain't going to understand it.\"",

         "Pirot, Serbia (CNN) -- In the backroom of a small house in Pirot in southeastern Serbia, a handful of women are fighting to keep an ancient craft alive. Their dexterous fingers race up and down large wooden looms, weaving the bold geometric patterns distinct to Pirot carpets. Once celebrated throughout Europe for their beauty, Pirot carpets graced the walls and floors of Serbian royal palaces, as well homes of the urban elite. Weaved for over four centuries in the town after which they were named -- Pirot, once a thriving trade center on the caravan route between east and west -- they were ceremonially rolled out for state visits, and given to foreign dignitaries. However, what was a thriving craft practiced by 5,000 weavers a century ago is now under threat of extinction, with only 10 women still keeping the tradition going. \"Pirot carpet weaving is our treasure which is passed on from generation to generation. It's the knowledge I learned from my mother and my grandmother,\" says Slavica Ciric who founded the Lady's Heart cooperative in Pirot with local women in 2009, to try to stop the skills nurtured throughout centuries from passing into oblivion. \"Carpet weaving is in our DNA,\" she continues. \"We were born on carpets and we grew up in houses filled with Pirot carpets.\" Mastery of craft . Pirot carpets are very thin but extremely dense, and are said to last more than a century. They have two identical sides and are geographically protected, which means that they can only be made in the Pirot area, and out of Pirot sheep -- a rare breed with only a few flocks counting just 250 sheep remaining. Weaving is painstaking work. It requires geometrical precision, supreme skill and creativity in equal measure. Everything is done by hand only, and in the same way as hundreds of years ago. It takes two weavers working simultaneously a month to create less than one square meter. Traditionally a female activity, young girls would start at the loom at the age of 10, practicing every day for five years to reach a level considered good enough. Their weaving skill had a great impact on their marriage prospects -- it was considered a measure of intelligence because of the knowledge of mathematics required to calculate the size and distribution of patterns. \"When you look at a carpet with an untrained eye, you can see beautiful colorful patterns, but we work out exactly how many of these patterns we can fit within a meter,\" says Ciric. \"We have to be visionaries and use logic to see where these patterns will stop, and where the border of the carpet will connect and finish,\" she adds. And if a weaver makes a mistake, the carpet is instantly pulled apart, even if the work was nearly completed. Magical meaning . The concentration necessary for this kind of precise work often means that once a weaver sits down at the loom, she loses all sense of time. \"The pattern in a mysterious way simply possesses her, drags her into the depth and she's so taken by her work that everything around her stops. She forgets about the time, she surrenders herself to the pattern,\" says Ciric. And it's those patterns that give Pirot carpets a mystical allure. Weavers say they represent ancient symbols which carry magical meanings and can be read as an image alphabet, and there are 95 varieties which weavers have to memorize. \"It is very mysterious but in every single carpet there is a story which you can read. When I see a carpet I can immediately tell whether it has been made now or in a different period, whether it has been made with love or only to be sold,\" says Ciric. Even though this skill is now practiced only by a handful of women, Ciric and her fellow weavers from Lady's Heart are trying to pass it on to the next generation, organizing winter courses for schoolchildren, including boys. \"There is a new generation coming along and if we manage to pass on this knowledge to them, I think there won't be any danger of this craft dying out,\" says Ciric. \"We are the guardians of the tradition of Pirot carpet weaving, and we do this with love.\" Read this: Resilient Belgrade rebuilds once again .

         "Tehran (CNN) -- His wife advised him not to go. His friends said it was too dangerous. But in 2011 veteran American football coach Dan Gaspar ignored the warnings and traveled to the Islamic Republic of Iran -- Washington's longtime political nemesis -- to help Iran's national football team qualify for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. \"Sports is my life,\" said Gaspar. \"When I came to Iran it didn't have anything to do with political reasons. My personality is one of adventure and curiosity. I wanted to experience a culture in a part of the world I had never been to.\" The goalkeeping coach's journey to Iran is the latest chapter in an international career that's taken the 58-year-old from the amateur football leagues in the U.S. state of Connecticut -- where he was born -- to the football capitals of the world. The Portuguese-American's resume includes stints with Major League Soccer's NY/NJ MetroStars and the Portuguese national team -- featuring megastar Cristiano Ronaldo -- which qualified for the 2010 World Cup. In 2011, Gaspar's friend and former colleague Carlos Queiroz was named head of coach of Iran's national football team. Soon after, Queiroz invited Gaspar to join the coaching staff in Iran. At the time, the Iranian government was locked in a bitter political feud with Washington. Iran regularly called the U.S. \"The Great Satan\". U.S. politicians frequently described Iran as a rogue nation led by a radical regime, secretly building a nuclear bomb. When discussing Washington's conflict with Tehran, U.S. President Barack Obama said that \"all options are on the table\", suggesting an attack against Iran was not out of the question. Despite the ominous climate Gaspar accepted the offer -- a decision his wife wasn't quite comfortable with. \"She was shocked,\" Gaspar said. \"She was concerned as most family members were.\" Gaspar admits he had concerns too. \"When we first arrived, we didn't know how to behave and how to react,\" he said. During his first few months Gaspar didn't socialize much and rarely left his apartment, except for trips to football practice. But Gaspar says he steadily started feeling comfortable. He says he learned his impressions of Iran, created mostly by the media, didn't quite match reality. \"When you listen to the news and you read the news, you see things. Sometimes during commercials I step off my couch and look out of the balcony and it's not what I am seeing, it's not what I am reading, it's not what I am hearing.\" Gaspar says what he has observed during his stay in Iran is a nation full of generous people who love their country, their food and their football team. One of his most memorable moments was meeting former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. \"He walked on to the pitch and asked everyone to sit down, and then he himself sat down on the grass,\" Gaspar said. \"I thought it was interesting how he put himself on the same level as everyone else. At the end of the day -- I saw him as another human being.\" In recent months, Gaspar's stay in Iran has coincided with a push by Tehran to improve relations with Washington, as moderate President Hassan Rouhani tries to settle Iran's nuclear dispute with the west. \"Right now more than ever there seems to be a lot of hope and optimism and a sense of energy that things will get better,\" says Gaspar. \"For me I believe in peace, and, if peace is an end result, then that's best for the world.\" But the highlight of Gaspar's Iranian adventure came on the night of June 18, when Iran's national football team recorded a 1-0 win over South Korea to qualify for the World Cup for only the fourth time. The win sparked frenzied celebrations on the field and in the streets of Tehran. \"There were a lot of tears, a lot of hugging. You can't describe it. Only a few privileged people have the opportunity to climb the mountain and go to the big dance in Brazil in 2014.\" Gaspar says his only disappointment that night was not being able to share the win with his wife and family back in America. His contract in Iran runs through World Cup in Brazil next June and July. He says his focus is to help Iran impress at the tournament and then return to America with some remarkable memories. \"If I would've listened to the experts, and my friends, and family, I would have never been here in Iran. It's been part of my life for three years and the memories will last a lifetime.\"",

         "(CNN) -- Samuel Eto'o netted a superb hat-trick to help holders Inter Milan thrash Werder Bremen 4-0 in Champions League Group A. The Cameroon striker opened the scoring in the 21st minute when he slipped the ball under goalkeeper Tim Wiese after Esteban Cambiasso robbed the ball off Daniel Jensen. Eto'o added his second when converting a lofted pass from Lucio and completed his treble nine minutes from time when out-pacing the Werder defence after latching onto Wes Sneijder's pass, and rounding Wiese. And Eto'o also had a hand in the goal that put Inter 3-0 ahead, with his pinpoint pass finding Sneijder -- and the Dutchman fired into the top corner. Inter are level on four points with Tottenham at the top of the table, after the London club beat Dutch champions FC Twente 4-1 in a remarkable match that saw Spurs awarded three penalties and also have Rafael van der Vaart sent off after collecting two yellow cards. Van der Vaart wasted a chance to put the hosts ahead when goalkeeper Nikolay Mihaylov saved his spot-kick after Peter Wisgerhof fouled Peter Crouch in the area. But Van der Vaart made amends soon after the break when converting on the turn a Crouch knock-down. Spurs soon made it 2-0 when Roman Pavlyuchenko scored from the penalty spot after a foul on Gareth Bale. Twente pulled a goal back through substitute Nacer Chadli before van der Vaart was given his marching orders for lunging in on Roberto Rosales. But Tottenham restored their two-goal advantage when Pavlyuchenko netted another spot-kick after a handball in the area and Bale added a late fourth to put the icing on the cake. Meanwhile, in Group B, French giants Lyon -- who are trailing in 18th place in their domestic league after just one victory all season -- claimed a morale- boosting 3-1 win at Israeli side Hapoel Tel Aviv.

         "Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama's re-election campaign released its June fundraising numbers Monday, reporting that it raised $71 million to Republican opponent Mitt Romney's approximately $100 million. The campaign responded with thanks to the more than 706,000 donors who got the campaign to that point but also appealed for more money. \"We still got beat -- and not by a little bit,\" Ann Marie Habershaw, chief operating officer for Obama for America, said in the e-mail. \"If we lose this election, it will be because we didn't close the gap enough when we had the chance.\" To be sure, neither campaign is raking in chump change.

While in Iowa in 2008, Obama was criticized for being out of touch after he asked a group of farmers whether they had checked out the price of arugula at Whole Foods. The boutique grocery store didn't open its first Iowa store until spring of this year, and several people present at his speech admitted they didn't know what arugula was. The current price is about $9 per pound. 3 Martha's Vineyard estates.

         "(CNN) -- Violence swept across Syria on Friday, with at least 43 people reported killed in another bloody day of confrontation between government forces and demonstrators calling for political change. Reliable numbers were difficult to come by. CNN bases its figures on reports from witnesses. Amnesty International, citing local human rights activists, reported that at least 75 people were killed in Friday's protests. The Syrian government does not permit CNN to report from inside the country. The killings occurred in several flashpoint regions as thousands of Syrian protesters defiantly marched after Muslims' weekly prayers in a display of mass discontent toward the government. Violence ripped through the Damascus suburbs of Douma, Moademy, and Zamalka, and other cities -- Homs, Harasta, and Izraa. The state-run news agency reported demonstrations and clashes, citing injuries but no deaths. Human rights groups and witnesses told a different story. \"Today, they have killed so many people. There are so many people injured and people have been kidnapped,\" Wissam Tarif, a human rights activist, told CNN. \"They are acting as an armed gang, not as security forces.\" The violence prompted international condemnation, with British Foreign Secretary William Hague calling the killings \"unacceptable,\" and calling on Syrian security forces \"to exercise restraint instead of repression, and on the Syrian authorities to respect the Syrian people's right to peaceful protest.\" Before Friday's marches, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said the death toll had exceeded 200 since the demonstrations began in mid-March. Human rights groups had been urging the government to refrain from cracking down on peaceful turnouts during the Facebook-inspired outpouring dubbed \"Great Friday.\" A witness in Douma said eight people died and approximately 25 were wounded when security forces fired on several thousand protesters. Riot police and secret police comprised the security forces and a sniper on a hospital roof was seen taking shots at people. Pellets and lethal rounds were used, the witness said, as people chanted for the downfall of the regime. A doctor in the Damascus suburb of Moadamy said six people were killed and dozens wounded when security forces fired in an \"indiscriminate and disproportionate manner\" on thousands of demonstrators. The doctor, a pediatrician, said it was difficult taking the wounded to the hospital. Syrian security forces had set up checkpoints across the area and were preventing anyone from entering or leaving the suburb. Five people were killed in the Damascus suburb of Zamalka, a witness said. An opposition leader in Homs said 12 people died and dozens were wounded when security forces fired on demonstrators. Protesters raced from the main streets for cover in smaller streets and alleys where they waited for the situation to calm. A witness said one of the dead was a 41-year-old demonstrator who was shot in the neck. Tarif said security forces fired on demonstrators from the southern city of Izraa who were trying to join protesters in nearby Daraa, killing nine and wounding others. Two people in Izraa reported seeing an assault on demonstrators and many casualties. An activist in Harasta in the south said 2,000 to 3,000 people met with a fierce crackdown by security forces, and heavy gunfire could be heard over the phone as the witness spoke. Three people have been killed and nine wounded, the source said. In protest, demonstrators burned down a police station. In Daraa, where the protests got their start last month, people shouted \"dignity and freedom!\" Activist Razan Zaitouneh in Damascus said security forces in the suburb of Sit Zainab fired on demonstrators who were tearing down a statue of Hafez al-Assad, the president's late father and the former ruler of Syria. She said three people were wounded when security forces opened fire in Hasaka in the northeast. Witnesses reported demonstrations in the capital, Damascus, where people chanted slogans and tear gas was fired amid a moderate security presence. Amateur video obtained by CNN purportedly shows demonstrations in Homs, Damascus, Banias, Kiswah, and Qamlishi. CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the material. The Syrian Arab News Agency said a \"limited number of demonstrators\" came out on Friday in the Damascus area, Hama, Deir Ezzour, Hasaka, Daraa, and Banias. It said security forces settled \"scuffles that erupted between demonstrators and citizens\" in Hama, Harasta, al-Hajar al-Aswad, and Hasaka. Demonstrations have been a daily occurrence across Syria for weeks and huge rallies have been common in the authoritarian state after Friday prayers across the predominantly Muslim nation. As people gathered to express their grievances toward the government, they've frequently been greeted with force from police. Friday's turnouts came a day after President Bashar al-Assad lifted the country's 48-year-old state of emergency and abolished the state security court, both of which were key demands of the demonstrators. The emergency law permitted the government to make preventive arrests and override constitutional and penal code statutes. The security court was a special body that prosecuted people regarded as challenging the government. Al-Assad's decrees on Thursday included recognizing and regulating the right to peaceful protest. They also extended the period that security forces can hold suspects in certain crimes. But Human Rights Watch says the decrees don't \"address the extensive immunity that Syrian law provides to members of its security services.\" It urged al-Assad to undertake more change, such as releasing political prisoners and those arrested for participating in peaceful protests, order probes in security force violations, ensure detainees gain \"prompt access to a lawyer,\" and amend repressive provisions of the penal code. It said the government, which is controlled by the Baath Party, should \"enact a political parties' law in compliance with international human rights norms.\" Such a law would allow the establishment of independent political parties. Hague urged the government to address the citizenry's \"legitimate demands.\" \"Political reforms should be brought forward and implemented without delay,\" he said. \"The Emergency Law should be lifted in practice, not just in word.\" Tarif also said that \"lifting the emergency law is a big joke while the security forces have impunity. \"This is going to become worse. Remember, tomorrow are the funerals,\" he said. U.S. President Barack Obama issued a statement in which he condemned \"in the strongest possible terms\" the use of force by the Syrian government against demonstrators. \"This outrageous use of violence to quell protests must come to an end now,\" he said. \"The Syrian people have called for the freedoms that all individuals around the world should enjoy: freedom of expression, association, peaceful assembly, and the ability to freely choose their leaders. President Assad and the Syrian authorities have repeatedly rejected their calls and chosen the path of repression.\" He accused Assad of \"blaming outsiders while seeking Iranian assistance in repressing Syria's citizens through the same brutal tactics that have been used by his Iranian allies.\" Obama added, \"The United States will continue to stand up for democracy and the universal rights that all human beings deserve, in Syria and around the world.\" In separate statements, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the spokesman for France's Ministry of European and Foreign Affairs condemned the violence.

         "(CNN) -- New HIV infections have fallen worldwide by 17 percent over the past eight years, a testament to prevention efforts, according to a U.N. report released Tuesday. In addition, the number of people living with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, has increased, and over the last five years, AIDS deaths have declined by 10 percent, thanks to antiretroviral drug therapy and access to lifesaving treatments, said the report by the Joint U.N. Program on HIV/AIDS and World Health Organization. However, not all the news was good as researchers found evidence that some prevention programs miss the mark because they are not tailored for different populations affected by the epidemic. Success was seen particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where new infections declined about 15 percent, or some 400,000 people, according to the report. However, that area remains the region hardest-hit by the virus, accounting for 67 percent of infections worldwide, the report said. \"The epidemic continues to have an enormous impact on households, communities, businesses, public services and national economies in the region,\" it said. In 2008, for instance, more than 14.1 million children in sub-Saharan Africa were estimated to have lost one or both parents to AIDS. In East Asia, new infections declined by nearly 25 percent, and by 10 percent in South and Southeast Asia, the organizations said. In Eastern Europe, a region that had seen a dramatic increase in new infections among intravenous drug users, \"the epidemic has leveled off considerably,\" the report said. In Eastern Europe and Central Asia, an HIV epidemic that once resulted from injected drug use is spreading to the sexual partners of those drug users, according to the report. And in some parts of Asia, heterosexual couples are being affected. The prevalence of HIV continues to increase in those regions because of the new infections, the report said. And in Swaziland in southern Africa, more than two-thirds of adult infections occur in people 25 and older, but few programs are aimed at those adults, the report said. While the decline in new infections is welcome, \"if we do a better job of getting resources and programs to where they will make most impact, quicker progress can be made and more lives saved,\" said Michael Sidibe, executive director of UNAIDS in Geneva, Switzerland. There is also an increased evidence of risk among key populations, the report said. For instance, although high prevalence among sex workers has been widely noted, evidence was limited on the prevalence among men engaging in homosexual activity and intravenous drug users. \"In recent years, studies have documented elevated levels of infection in these populations in nearly all regions,\" according to the report. \"In all settings and for diverse types of epidemics, it is clear that programs to prevent new infections among these key populations must constitute an important part of national AIDS responses.\" Also, the level of resources directed at prevention programs for those key groups is \"typically quite low, even in concentrated epidemics,\" according to the report. Another shortage can be seen in the programs that are designed for people living with HIV.",

         "CHENGDU, China (CNN) -- Rainy weather and poor logistics thwarted efforts by relief troops who walked for hours over rock, debris and mud on Tuesday in hopes of reaching the worst-hit area of an earthquake that killed nearly 10,000 in central China, state-run media reported. Setting out from Maerkang in Sichuan Province at 8 p.m. Monday, the 100 or so troops had to travel 200 kilometers (124 miles) to go before reaching Wenchuan, the epicenter of the quake, also in the province, Xinhua reported. After seven hours, they still had 70 kilometers (43 miles) to go. \"I have seen many collapsed civilian houses, and the rocks dropped from mountains on the roadside are everywhere,\" the head of the unit, Li Zaiyuan, told Xinhua. Added CNN Correspondent John Vause: \"The roads here are terrible in the best of times ... right now they're down right atrocious. They've resorted to going in one man at a time on foot.\" Nearly all the confirmed deaths were in Sichuan Province, but rescuers were hindered because roads linking it to the provincial capital, Chengdu, were damaged, Xinhua reported. Local radio quoted disaster relief officials as saying a third of the buildings in Wenchuan collapsed from the quake and another third were seriously damaged. The earthquake was powerful enough to be felt throughout most of China. Many children were buried under the rubble of their schools. The Chinese government said the death toll was sure to rise. An expert told CNN the 7.9-magnitude quake at about 2:28 p.m. Monday (6:28 a.m. GMT) was the largest the region has seen \"for over a generation.\" Residents as far as Chongqing -- about 200 miles from the epicenter in Sichuan Province -- spent the night outdoors, too afraid of aftershocks to sleep indoors. Local radio in Sichuan quoted disaster relief officials as saying a third of the buildings in Wenchuan collapsed from the quake and another third were seriously damaged.  Watch as the death toll rises » . The state-run Zhongxin news agency reported that a survivor who escaped Beichuan county in Sichuan Province described the province as having been \"razed to the ground.\" The Red Cross Society of China, coordinating some of the international aid efforts, encouraged financial donations because of the difficulty of getting supplies to those most in need. At least six schools collapsed to some extent in the quake or aftershocks that followed, Xinhua reported.  See a report on rescue operations at the school » . At one school, almost 900 students -- all eighth-graders and ninth-graders, according to a local villager -- were believed to be buried.  See workers in Chengdu hiding under their desks during the quake » . At least 50 bodies were pulled from the rubble by Monday night at Juyuan Middle School in Juyuan Township of Dujiangyan City, Sichuan Province, Xinhua reported. \"Some buried teenagers were struggling to free themselves from the ruins while others were calling for help. Eight excavators were working at the site. Devastated parents watched as five cranes worked at the site and an ambulance waited,\" Xinhua reported. \"A tearful mother said her son, ninth-grader Zhang Chengwei, was buried in the ruins.\" Meanwhile, 2,300 people were buried in two collapsed chemical plants in Sichuan's Shifang city, and 80 tons of ammonia leaked out, Xinhua reported. Six hundred people died there. The plants were among a series of buildings that collapsed, including private homes, schools and factories. The local government has evacuated 6,000 civilians from the area and was dispatching firefighters to help at the scene, Xinhua reported. Much of the nation's transportation system shut down. Xinhua reported there were \"multiple landslides and collapses along railway lines\" near Chengdu.  Quake victims have been sleeping outside in Chengdu » . Sichuan Province sits in the Sichuan basin and is surrounded by the Himalayas to the west. The Yangtze River flows through the province and the Three Gorges Dam in the nearby Hubei Province controls flooding to the Sichuan -- though there were no reports of damage to the world's largest dam. Monday's quake was caused by the Tibetan plateau colliding with the Sichuan basin, Zhigang Peng, an earthquake expert at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia, told CNN. \"Earthquakes in this part of China are infrequent but not uncommon,\" he said. The last major earthquake in the region occurred in the northwestern margin of the Sichuan basin when a 7.5-magnitude quake killed more than 9,300 people on August 25, 1933. President Hu Jintao ordered an all-out effort to help those affected, and Premier Wen Jiabao traveled to the region to direct the rescue work, Xinhua reported. \"My fellow Chinese, facing such a severe disaster, we need calm, confidence, courage and efficient organization,\" Wen was quoted as saying. \"I believe we can certainly overcome the disaster with the public and the military working together under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the government.\" Peter Sammonds, professor of geophysics at University College London, called the earthquake \"tremendous.\" \"Particularly in the more remote, the more mountainous part where this has taken place, a lot of the buildings are built on sediments that are quite unstable. They're probably liquifying, causing the buildings to collapse. You might expect landslides to occur, which could actually stop the relief efforts going through on the roads, so this could be very grim in the remoter, more mountainous parts of this province.\" While many of the most immediate efforts were focused on Sichuan Province, Xinhua also reported dead and injured in Gansu, Chongqing and Yunnan provinces. A provincial government spokesman said they feared more dead and injured in collapsed houses in Dujiangyan City in Wenchuan County. A driver for the seismological bureau said he saw \"rows of houses collapsed\" in Dujiangyan, Xinhua reported. Bonnie Thie, the country director of the Peace Corps, told CNN she was on a university campus in Chengdu about 60 miles from the epicenter, in the eastern part of China's Sichuan province, when the first quake hit. \"You could see the ground shaking,\" Thie told CNN. The shaking \"went on for what seemed like a very long time,\" she said. Bruce Presgrave, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey, said this quake could cause major damage because of its strength and proximity to major population centers. Also, it was relatively shallow,  and those kinds of quakes tend to do more damage near the epicenter than deeper ones, Presgrave said. An earthquake with 7.5 magnitude in the northern Chinese city of Tangshan killed 255,000 people in 1976 -- the greatest death toll from an earthquake in the last four centuries and the second greatest in recorded history, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Tangshan is roughly 995 miles (1,600 km) from Chengdu, the nearest major city to the epicenter of Monday's quake.  Read an explanation about earthquakes » . After the quake struck Monday, the ground shook as far away as Beijing, which is 950 miles (1,528 km) from the epicenter. Residents of the Chinese capital, which hosts this year's Olympic Games in August, felt a quiet, rolling sensation for about a minute.  See CNN's interview with an American in Chengdu » . Thousands of people were evacuated from Beijing buildings immediately after the earthquake. At least seven more earthquakes -- measuring between 4.0 and 6.0 magnitudes -- happened nearby over the four hours after the initial quake at at 2:28 p.m. local time, the USGS reported. A spokesman for the Beijing Olympic Committee said no Olympic venues were affected. The huge Three Gorges Dam -- roughly 400 miles east of the epicenter -- was not damaged, a spokesman said. The earthquake was also felt in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Taiwan, and as far away as Hanoi, Vietnam, and Bangkok, Thailand, according to the Hong Kong-based Mandarin-language channel Phoenix TV.
